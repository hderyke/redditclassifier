What bar did my uncle take me to in 1992?,"The answer to this question probably isn‚Äôt knowable| but I‚Äôd love to hear some speculation. My favorite uncle| who had a weird side job being a secret shopper for Taco Bell in the early ‚Äò90s| took me and my brother with him one afternoon when I was 11 or 12. Eating at four or five Taco Bells in a row was obviously of great interest to me at that age. He also took us to his regular bar| the first I‚Äôd ever been to. I‚Äôve often wondered which it was. He doesn‚Äôt remember. We weren‚Äôt from Cincinnati and I was 12 years old| so I don‚Äôt know the area well| but here‚Äôs what I recall:

He was a mainstay of the local hardcore scene| having fronted an agit-prop punk group that was part of the Jockey Club scene| and also an educator and union guy| so those were his people. Or at least he was tolerated by them. He was definitely a regular because he introduced us to the bartender. 

The bar was probably on the east side of town. He lived in Mt. Washington but it was in the city. 

It was on a commercial street alongside other 19th C. buildings ‚Äî not in a strip mall or detached building. It was street parking. 
It had a shuffleboard court inside. 

Everyone seems old when you‚Äôre 12 but it definitely felt like an old man bar. The clientele seemed 40+. He was in his late thirties at the time. 

I think there was a front and back. Front bar was high tops and lots of neon. 

That‚Äôs all I remember. Realizing this could be like 50 different places| any guesses?

Beware. Local company recording interactions in home ,"As an employee it feels wrong but as a human it feels even more wrong| so I have to let this info out. 

This is a throw away account for obvious reasons. 

Ohio law states that if a conversation is being recorded and 1 party is aware of it then it‚Äôs totally legal. It‚Äôs called a 1 party state. 

Apollo home has a new software that they‚Äôve been using for the last few months called Rilla. Rilla is designed to listen in and critique your customer interactions with every customer. It will even tell you if you‚Äôre using the wrong inflections to close a sale. Every time you have an Apollo home employee in your home be fully aware that the conversation between you and them in your home is being recorded. They are all reviewed by management and the Rilla team. This is not something they tell you about or disclose because based on Ohio law this is not illegal.  

I feel wrong using this and people not knowing but we‚Äôre told not to tell the customer that it is even a thing. So consider this a buyer beware for your future interactions with us as a hvac| plumbing or electrical provider.

Metro Route 1 Expansion,"I know this seems like a long shot| but what do people think the likelihood of Rt. 1 expanding to weekends (or at least later on weekdays) is in the future? Rt. 1 only runs 5 days a week at 7 times daily| and the last bus is at 7:05pm. I know there is a shortage of drivers that are leading to this| but as someone who takes this route at least 2-3 times per week to my office in Covington| it would be awesome to be able to utilize this on weekends or at least later on week days. The ability to take the bus back up the hill instead of walking is immensely underrated. The Transit app is super easy| and the busses are always very pleasant to ride. 

I know this seems like a long shot| but as someone who desparately wants improved transit for our city| having regular| dedicated routes for these ""CBD-adjacent"" neighborhoods (many of which are very hilly) is a great first step in trying to increase overall ridership (though I know we're almost back to pre-COVID numbers as of June of last year).

Who can I yell at?,"First world problem incoming...

I have altafiber internet.  It's great.  I also pay like $75 for YoutubeTV| and I thought I might save a few bucks switching to the Altafiber internet/cable bundle.  They have one advertised for about $90| which sounded pretty good.

As I'm talking to the agent| she says my monthly bill will be more like $150.  Hold up!  Turns out aside from equipment rental| there's almost $50 in ""fees and taxes.""

It's not the agent's fault.  She didn't make the policy. But I want to be able to call or email Altafiber and voice my displeasure| and there doesn't seem to be a listed method of doing that| short of hassling a CSR who can't control it either.

Is there an email or a form I can yell into?  I 100% realize it won't change a goddamned thing| and I should apparently just eat shit with a big smile on my face| but seriously...

Street harassment is a serious issue in Cincinnati,"I (29f) have lived in Cinci four years| and have come to notice in that time that I get sexually accosted by men I don‚Äôt know here‚Ä¶ a LOT. 

For context| I am from the rural south. As a good-lookin‚Äô woman| I‚Äôve always experienced some degree of harassment from men since childhood| but the frequency with which it happens here in Queen City is frankly abhorrent. I‚Äôm often accosted four times or more while out on my walks| even WITH my dog in tow. Men will pull their cars over to talk to me| follow me down the street| call to me from a distance etc. I‚Äôve had men badger me for personal info at work. Two different men have tried to follow me home after dark  in the last TWO DAYS. 

I‚Äôve noticed a trend in behavior like this increasing when it‚Äôs warm out (I wonder why) which is disgusting| but it seems especially bad this year. Idk what is going on. 

Does any woman actually like being accosted by strangers in public? I don‚Äôt! 


EDIT: for the *very particular| teeny tiny lol so small* subset of men starting to leak into this comment section: if you go to my profile| you will see that I‚Äôm a recovering alcoholic with a diagnosed mental illness. Oh my god!!! HORRIBLE!!!!!!!! I must be lying!!! 

If you think my lived experience is unbelievable| try broadening your horizons. Not being able to see past your own nose is a character defect; it‚Äôs called being self-centered.

Mental Health Help / Recommendations?,"Hi everyone| I'm hoping someone here can help me. Without getting into all the reasons why| I've decided recently that I'd like to make an appointment with a psychologist/psychiatrist (I'm sorry| I don't understand the difference) in an effort to understand myself better. I've been reading about a specific kind of mental health disorder that I've found has resonated with me| and I'd like to speak with a professional about it instead of trying to self-diagnose anything. 

However| when I attempted to look up what to do or how to go about this online| all I could find were aggregation sites that are just clearly pulling the names of therapists and other related positions and displaying them| but with almost no help as to whether these people are trustworthy| what their credentials are| or if they are even the correct people to speak to about my issue. 

So I'm turning to Reddit in hopes that someone can help. Does anyone know of a reputable practice/facility in the area that offers mental health services (especially more advanced ones like being about to diagnose certain issues)? Does anyone have any experience (good or bad) with any mental health professionals in the area? Does anyone even know of a reputable website where I might be able to find this information myself?

Follow up - Homeless man ODing in Clifton on Ludlow ,"Some might remember the recent post about a homeless man possibly ODing by Upside Cafe in Clifton. I identified him as ‚Äúdreadlocks guy‚Äù and said that he was dangerous and to steer clear. 

Some folks took great issue with this comment and argued that he should be left alone. 

Well| he spent the last week going into shops and aggressively harassing workers and patrons. The police were called multiple times by both workers and shoppers who felt unsafe. 

Today he was arrested| his mugshot can be found online as well as his record of previous Hamilton County arrests. 

I do understand that issues surrounding addiction| homelessness| panhandling and mental illness are very polarizing. Unfortunately not all of these folks are safe to be around.

Fortunately you do not have to accept this behavior in your community. If you see illegal activity| call it in. It takes effort but we can have clean safe neighborhoods.

Recommendations for Junk Removal (or Dumpster Rental),"Located on the West Side - in between Covedale/Price Hill/Green Township

TL;DR : junk removal OR dumpster rental recommendations for a few large items

I have an old reclining loveseat and a mattress I need gone for sure - possibly some big tree branches and other junk also.

I called a junk removal place (family friend‚Äôs business)| and it was $350 to just haul away a loveseat and mattress üôÉ is this a normal price? Seems expensive!

I also emailed rumpke about large item pickup and they had very specific instructions - seems like a lot of work on our end for them to pickup| and they can‚Äôt do it in one pickup either. $30 per large pick up request| but if I‚Äôm reading the email right| I would have to take apart the loveseat into four pieces| and wrap all of them in plastic| as well as fold and wrap the mattress... then they do 5 pickups? (Could be interpreting the email wrong). My sister and I can hardly lift the loveseat| so we would struggle trying to take it apart. 

I‚Äôm open to the idea of a dumpster rental - if we‚Äôre going to be spending $$$| does it make sense to get a dumpster rental and just go nuts throwing stuff away? Could also ask our neighbor if they had stuff to get rid of (I‚Äôm confident they have some stuff) and then we could split the cost to make it cheaper for us both.

"CPD Chief on Withrow HS shooting: ""There's nothing we could have done...we can't stop every party"".","That quote is from Chief Theetge at the gun violence press conference earlier this AM.  For context| CPD was called for a noise complaint at Withrow HS and they found a party ""behind the school"".  They found ""no violations"" and left.  Not long after| 30-40 shots were fired and an 18 year old died.

On one hand| I get it...kids want to get together and celebrate...But on the other hand| we've seen time and time again in Cincinnati that groups of kids| left unsupervised in the early hours of the morning  will end up in fights or shootings...and in this case| homicide.  Also| the kids were partying at the school| which should(?) legally be off limits after dark.  CPD turning a blind eye to 30+ kids at 1-2AM just shows they lack any will to intervene in a meaningful way.  Theetge is just passing the buck.

Apartment building for actual adults downtown ?,"I find myself nearing 40 while living in a building that‚Äôs on the corner of fourth and a street-named-after-a-purple-shaded fruit.

While during the winter and fall it‚Äôs quiet| spring and summer bring a bunch of visitors to tenants that cause problems - ie they bring dogs they don‚Äôt clean up after| broken glass on the pool area and within the shared spaces of the property| etc. Management has been stretched thin since the day I moved in years ago| even after changing staff a few times; it‚Äôs always been this way and forever will be. I wasn‚Äôt even near the age of the average tenant when I first moved in; it was winter and I saw nobody but the leasing agent. 

*shrugs*

Yes I knew what I was getting into living downtown. 
Yes I know that density creates opportunity for these situations. 
Yes I know living downtown is much different than say| West Chester.
This is specific to my building and the average age of folks living here. 

Beyond moving into an old folks home| are there any buildings/complexes that aren‚Äôt chock full of 21 to 25 year olds downtown? At 21-25 there‚Äôs no way I could have afforded to live here| so the level of responsibility with the crowds is low since it‚Äôs not on them as tenants to give a shit. ‚ÄúThe lease is under Daddy‚Äôs name; he will handle it.‚Äù

I work here| invest here| am part of the residents council and don‚Äôt want to have to move out of the CBD. My building is a notorious party spot (didn‚Äôt know when I signed the initial lease years ago)| and it‚Äôs not going to change until they literally set the roof on fire. Some tenants are older than me and have been here longer| they just tolerate things differently. To each their own. 

So I pose the question: where are all the downtowners that don‚Äôt want to buy a condo and still rent because they love the city and want to stay in the downtown/CBD area?

Let the shit-talking and downvotes begin‚Ä¶ 
But any suggestions are appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1cw31x6/apartment_building_for_actual_adults_downtown/,0

Ode to the Mill Creek ,I know most think gross sewage and foul smells when you hear anything about the Mill Creek.  When I was a child in the 90s the Creek was still very foul and stinked in the the summer.  I grew up around the Mill Creek and have watched it become beautiful again.  I live near it and walk around it often. There are so many beautiful plants and flowers now. An abundance of wildlife everywhere! I often see Bald Eagles|  Herons| Turtles|  huge fat happy fish| and in the winter it is filled with thousands of crows. I joined the Mill Creek Alliance on  canoe trip and saw the absolute wonders of the Creek many can't witnesses from land.  I've seen countless people fishing there and if you go through the gates of the Greenway trail near northside you can walk on the edges and see so many beautiful things. I'm hoping the Creek will get better and better as the years go on. I'm grateful to the people who watch over it and the changes in policies that have helped it be less polluted.

""The church has recently entered a building spree| with more than 150 temples planned or under construction.""¬† [Here's the comprehensive list¬†](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/list?lang=eng)

Much like airports| the temples may be named after a city but they are often sited in a small| nearby town.¬† ""From Nevada to Wyoming to Texas| small towns have become neighborhood battlegrounds as feuds break out about the buildings‚Äô height and light.""¬† The current designs are much more obtrusive than necessary| often damaging town character¬†such as this [88|000 square foot building](https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/heber-valley-utah-temple/news/) on an 18 acre site in a town that was once celebrated for its dark sky initiatives and stunning mountain views| in contrast to the [Chicago Temple ](https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/chicago-illinois-temple/)(actually in a wealthy suburb 45 minutes north of the city) which| while still big| and still intruding upon a historic home| museum| and nature preserve| fits in a bit better with the local community aesthetic.

The article cites people who ""...are adamant: They have nothing against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or its members.¬† What the DeLoes do have a problem with is the church‚Äôs plans to build a[ 215-foot-high building with hundreds of parking spots](https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/lone-mountain-nevada-temple/) in an area where residents sometimes ride horses in the street and the tallest things around are palm trees.""

LDS Temples are not churches.¬† They are not open on Sunday.  They are considered holier than traditional meetinghouses and function as private clubs--visitors are \*not\* allowed.¬† They are used to baptize dead people and perform other Masonic| patriarchal ordinances for them [even if this is against family wishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_for_the_dead#Controversy) ; these same ordinances are done once for the living member themselves. In order to enter you must follow a set of rules that includes paying [10% of your income](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/26-temple-recommends?lang=eng) to the church's investment and operations portfolio (donations for charitable works are an additional| optional charge) and wearing [holy garments (""magic underwear"")](https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders/2024/04/14/first-presidency-letter-garmet-of-the-holy-priesthood-temple-recommend-statement/)¬†¬†Adherence to these rules is assessed in interviews with untrained| volunteer ""bishops"" who will also ask you about your sexuality and may ask invasive questions about your sexual practices.¬† Such questions [may be asked of children as young as 11 years old.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/24/us/mormon-young-excommunicated/index.html)

""The last thing this city needs is another lawsuit|‚Äù Commissioner Donald Walsh said before casting his vote in the temple‚Äôs favor.""¬† This politician's perspective is pragmatic.¬† If your town does not have airtight ordinances| [the LDS church will sue your community](https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/lds-church-sues-city-of-cody-over-planning-process/article_e939d660-275c-11ee-b954-7f32fc2003d8.html) at [every turn](https://www.kpcw.org/wasatch-county/2024-05-02/judge-allows-lds-church-to-join-heber-valley-temple-lawsuit).  Their access to [liquid assets ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/mormon-church-whistleblower-taxes-hedge-fund)and [land ](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12868689/mormon-church-owns-land-bill-gates-china.html)is unprecedented [for a religion in the US.¬†](https://widowsmitereport.wordpress.com/)¬†

If a building like the temples currently being built is not in harmony with the goals of your community| the time is now to ensure that local code prevents them.¬†¬†

In order to function| LDS temples do not have to be huge| they do not have to have spires| they do not have to be brightly lit.¬† By banning buildings that are out of character with your community| you are not banning LDS church members| nor preventing their faithful practices| you are simply deciding for yourselves what your community should look like.

Not that it should need to be said| but this post is not about members.  Most LDS members themselves are nice people and usually make great neighbors.¬† They will nearly always help you move and are happy to bring cookies.¬† This is not an issue against LDS members| their faith| or practices.¬† It is an issue about the Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints bullying communities to accommodate obtrusive buildings against resident's wills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1cuydrd/the_lds_churchs_historic_templebuilding_spree_is/,0

Office building conversions to residential ,"While the ongoing changes to the zoning codes will hopefully expand housing availability in the city| one trend I think could have an even bigger positive effect on the vibrancy of our downtown area is converting underutilized office buildings into residences| as this story describes. Not only does it make better use of existing structures| it increases people living downtown| which also helps support restaurants and shops that have typically relied mostly on lunchtime crowds that WFH have reduced a lot since COVID. I'd like to see City Council doing what they can to support these efforts (short of shoveling public funds into developers' private pockets).

Reflecting on Kraftwerk @ MegaCorp Pavilion - May 16,"Last night Kraftwerk played what I would think to be one of the most anticipated concerts of 2024 in Greater Cincinnati. 

Let me state upfront that I had seen Kraftwerk in concert a couple of times before| but that was about 15 years ago. Since then| nothing really has changed. No new albums or new material. Same lineup with one original member still at it (Ralph Hutter). 

Kraftwerk had never before played here| and the mere thought that not only they would be playing here| but doing so at an intimate venue like MegaCorp Pavilion (indoor capacity 2|700) made this a must-see event| period.

There was no opening act. Kraftwerk came on stage at about 8:25 pm| and dove straight into its traditional opener Numbers/Computer World/Computer World Part 2.

When playing Spacelab early in the show| the video paying on a massive screen behind the band showed a flying saucer hovering above the Greater Cincinnati skyline| and eventually landing at MegaCorp| to a massive reaction from the crowd.

Midway into their set| Kraftwerk played the entire ""Autobahn"" album front to back| in celebration of the album's 50th anniversary this year.

The sound mix was absolutely perfect| as were the visuals (a massive part of the Kraftwerk experience). What makes Kraftwerk so interesting is that| despite much of their material being 40+ years old| they nevertheless have retained their aura of being ""ahead of their time""| and last night proved that point once again.

They played a 2 hr. set and when the band's traditional closer (Boing Boom Tschak/Techno Pop/Musique Non Stop)| I couldn't believe it all had come and gone so fast.

I absolutely loved last night's show. I had taken my (grown-up) daughter along. She had never actively listened to any of Kraftwerk's music before. But she did recognize several of the songs| and more importantly| she seemed to enjoy the overall experience.

Here the setlist from last night:

Mold Found in A/C Provided by Landlord. How do I get them to replace it or disinfect it? What steps should I take if the issue is not take care of?,"I‚Äôve been living in my rental for about 4 years. The property is provided with the following appliances: A/C window unit| stove| dishwasher| and fridge. These appliances are listed in my lease as provided by the landlord. 

This year I performed a mold test on the A/C due to some concerns I had about the musty smell coming from the unit when I turned it on.
They came back positive for mold. I alerted my landlord about this on 4/27. Initially| they told me to clean the filter. I did that but I am unconvinced that the dirty filter was the source of the mold. 

I told them I wanted the inside of the unit disinfected or the whole unit replaced. Landlord attempted to open unit initially but gave up after about 15 min saying they would research how to open it| citing a fear of breaking it. That was about 2 weeks ago. The days are getting warmer and I would like to be able to use my A/C unit in June. However| I fear that my landlord is dragging their feet on fixing this issue in the hopes that I will just give up and not ask them about it any more. 

I read online that you can file a complaint with the city health department about mold in rental units and they will send someone out to verify the complaint. If the unsuitable living condition is verified| they can sent a written statement to the landlord about the issue to expedite the process and issue a citation to unresponsive landlords. I have also research rent escrow as a possible option if the issue is not fixed. 

Does anyone have any more knowledge or experiences dealing with similar situations in Cincinnati? If so| what is the best course of action for me to take? I‚Äôm reading conflicting info on whether mold removal or removal of faulty provided appliances falls under landlord responsibilities or not. Would appreciate some guidance on how to proceed.

Louis Langree's extraordinary Grand Finale as the CSO's Music Director,"This weekend marked the Cincinnati Symphony's last concerts of the 23-24 Season| and of course with it the last concerts of Louis Langree's 11 year tenure as the Orchestra's Music Director.

There were performances on Friday and Saturday evening| and the very last one was this Sunday afternoon at 2 pm. There was zero chance that I would be missing this.

Before the start of the concert| the CSO President came out and said some kind words about Maetro Langree| reminding us of the many milestones reached during that time. Louis Langree addressed the crown briefly| and that he would have more today during the second half of the concert.

That second half turned out to be memorable on many levels. After an inspired ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (by the French composer Paul Dukas)| Langree did address the audience| at length. He mentioned that his wife and 2 (now college-aged) kids were in the audience| and reminisced how warmly the city had welcomes them all those years ago. Langree also commented very warmly about other aspects of life in Cincinnati| including the vibrant cultural scene. His biggest complements were for the Orchestra itself| and how he loved acquiring the ""Cincinnati DNA of this Orchestra"". He pointed out many things about the CSO| including the fact  that during his 11 year tenure| 37 musicians (more than 1/3 of the orchestra) were hired| and also that one of the orchestra's musicians was retiring after today's concert| having played 34 (!) years with the CSO.

Langree then dove into the very last piece of the day| an outstanding ""Daphnis et Chloe Suite No. 2"" by French composer Maurice Ravel. Upon the conclusion of that deeply emotional work| the audience burst into applause| and simply would not stop applauding. I saw some people leaving but the vast majority stayed and clapped. After several minutes of this| Louis Langree addressed the audience again| expressing his gratitude| etc. Then he told the true story that after his appointment as the CSO Music Director| the first concert he saw was actually a Cincinnati Pops show| with John Morris Russell conducting the Pops (which are of course the same musicians as the Symphony) playing action movie music like Mission Impossible| and James Bond. ""I was blown away"" gushed Langree| and then reminded us of having ""impossible dreams"" when he came to Cincinnati| which he eventually ended with ""I can now say: ""Mission Accomplished!""| and with that he led the CSO in playing the ""Mission Impossible"" theme. 

It was by all accounts an extraordinary afternoon of music. I was also there for the last show of the departing prior Music Directors Jesus Lopez Cobos (in 2001) and Paavi Jarvi (in 2011)| and  it was nothing like what we witessed this afternoon at Music Hall.

Last but not least| Louis Langree reminded us that he will be back from time to time for the occasional concert| but most of all| he urged all of us to welcome the CSO's new Music Director Cristian M”ëcelaru with same warmth and open arms as he was welcomed here back in 2013.

Thank you for everything| Louis Langree! Godspeed to you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1cqky22/louis_langrees_extraordinary_grand_finale_as_the/,0
