Seeking new friends ,"I'm trying to put myself out there and look for some new friends. First I'd like to ask if there are already other resources available that might be better platforms to find friends. I've done some browsing on Meetup| but I've felt really hesitant about the events I've seen on there. But if anyone knows of other better platforms| I would be interested.

That being said I'll also just tell you a little about myself to see if anyone who reads this might be interested.

I am a late 20s man. I went to college here in Indy| got my BS in a hard science| and I've been working here since graduating. Recently married to a woman. We currently live in Irvington. And I've been trying recently to better myself and putting myself out there to find new friends is just one of the many things on that list.

I like playing games of all kinds; video games| table tops| D&D| card games and I'm willing to try /learn new games. I am not very competitive and so I would be looking for something pretty friendly. I enjoy video games mostly for a good narrative. Not much of an online gamer.

I am not very athletic these days| but I would be willing to try some friendly sports or other outdoor activities. I don't currently go to a gym but I could be convinced of being a gym accountability buddy or something like that. Just understand that I would be starting from couch potato level for any of this. But I'm willing to try

I love lots of different types of food. Very willing to try lots of different cultures. Love cooking with my wife and sharing a good meal amongst friends. I can appreciate a good beer

I appreciate a fairly wide variety of music. Definitely enjoyed going to the Wonder Road festival in Garfield Park the last two years. I haven't been there a lot| but I think the Hi-Fi is a cool venue and would be interested in seeing more bands there.

I like VERY casually watching sports and not taking it seriously. I'm not ever the one you should ask about specific teams or players.

And just to keep this as open ended as possible| I'm willing to hear suggestions of other activities.

I would be interested in a commitment of meeting up once every 1 - 3 weeks. Very flexible around that number. Definitely don't need a super heavy commitment from anybody| especially starting out. Let me know if any of this sounds good to you.

Just a dude who is learning to love himself a little more. Thanks for reading ",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1d1icpz/seeking_new_friends/,1

Dog Rescues - help re-homing my brother’s aggressive dog,"Hi all|

I’ll try and be concise. My brother and his ex fiancé adopted a dog together that they didn’t train and honestly barely took care of. When she left| she left the dog as his responsibility (she’s chipped to his ex| she wanted the dog).

He board and trained her with a reputable trainer who said she was fine under his care| taught him the tools| etc. but the same behaviors returned once he was home. Im not sure how consistent he was in actually using these tools though (I don’t live with him as we are both adults).

I think it’s hard for him to admit| but he realizes now he’s not equipped to train or take care of her the way she needs. I also think he’s having a hard time with this information and not exploring all options.

They are talking about euthanasia as the next step.

Please only reply with helpful comments. Do not post judgement on my brother| it’s absolutely no excuse but this is where he is at| I’m doing my best to help find a way to re-home her over euthanasia. I do think in the right setting with someone who is equipped to train her| she could be a great companion.

She is a large-ish black lab mixed with maybe some type of hound? She is like a lab but a bit more lanky| black with a white strip on her belly. She does have bite history.

Aggressive dogs. Worried about retaliation if I call animal control. ,"What would you do?
There are people in my neighborhood with 2 aggressive German Shepherds. I jog and walk around the neighborhood. Yesterday| the 2 dogs charged me in the street. They kept chasing me as I backed away and yelled at them. They were showing teeth| barking| and looking for an opportunity to lunge at me. An owner kept calling them and finally got them to come. She just said “sorry about that.” I said “there are kids in this neighborhood.” Including my 3 year old that I walk with. She just turned her back to me| kind of put a dismissive hand in the air and said “I know.”
Today| I was running again. I had thick branch this time just in case. The dogs were out again. There was a different owner. The dogs growled but they didn’t charge me this time. The owner kind of stared at me and just waved me on like even though I was running I was lingering and inconveniencing him.
I really want to contact the authorities| because after yesterday| it’s obvious these dogs are territorial and they will attack people on the street. Myself and a lot of my neighbors walk around| including kids and other pets. These people obviously don’t care about their dogs being loose and being aggressive with strangers. My concern is them retaliating even though they are clearly in the wrong.

Moving to Indy - 220 Meridian query and general luxury apartment recommendations,"Hi there! I am due to move to Indy in about 3 months time from overseas and I was wondering if anyone here could advise on their thoughts on apartments.

I am hoping to get a 2 bed apartment and have a budget up to about $2800 or so - but I could maybe push it a bit if I had somewhere I really wanted.

I was looking at 220 meridian - and it obviously looks amazing. What are people’s thoughts? I have been trying to work out what fees there are (utilities| trash| parking etc.) - does anyone know what they are? I have no pets so that one is fine.

The only downside of 220 Meridian for me is not having a balcony - I note there is a little window that can be cracked open in most of the apartments it seems. How have people found them? Do you miss the air circulation? Does it get very hot in the summer with the glass?

Lastly (sorry for all the questions!)| I am moving to Indy on my own as a female in my early 30s. So I was also hoping to find somewhere that organised community events or opportunities to meet new people. Is 220 any good for that| or does anyone have other recommendations?

Riese & Muller black cargo e bike rider,"Does anyone know the man who rides this bike up and down the Monon?  He’s a white man. Balding head with a pony tail. Maybe in his 50s. Today he didn’t even slow down while on the monon to cross 46th street. It was 5:20 pm and 46th street was bustling. A car driving on 46th street may have hit him at slow speed.  I couldn’t tell. He just rode right off. He does this all the time and is going to get hit (deservedly so) if he keeps flying across the street. If you know him| explain to him that he may ruin someone’s life WHEN they hit him for doing nothing wrong.  That’s all. Rant over. But seriously| if you know him| please knock some sense into him.

Underground Explosion and House Shaking,"All| I have lived in Indy since 2017 close to 96th and Allisonville in the Castelton area.  Ever since I started working from home during COVID| randomly during business hours/days| I will hear something that sounds like an explosion underground then my whole house shakes.  It just happened today again 5/24/2024 at 3:50pm EDT.

It has drove me nuts for years and I would really like to get to the bottom of it because today was rough enough that windows chattered from shaking and one of these days it is going to do some damage.

My hypothesis is that it has something to do with the Martin Marietta North Indianapolis Mine just a couple miles North West of my house.  It is the only thing that makes logical sense to me.  It only happens during week days and business hours.  It happens maybe once a week at most.  It is not large trucks on the street or low flying jets.  I have been outside many times and experienced this| you can feel the ground shake under your feet right after you hear the rumble.

Recommendations for Plane-Spotting at KIND?,"Hello| r/Indianapolis| from a frequent traveler to your fine city. And also from a guy who enjoys aviation.

Next week I'm in town on business| and I'll have a big chunk of time to kill and decided (weather permitting) I'd like to just prop up somewhere for an afternoon and watch arrivals and departures at KIND. Do any other aviation enthusiasts recommend a good spot for setting up a camp chair| tuning into KIND tower and traffic| pulling up my charts on Navigraph for study and tracking arrivals and departures on live radar| and relaxing and eating sandwiches? (I'm mostly interested in watching jetliners.)

I've only spent minimal time in the cell-phone waiting lot| which seems pretty nicely set up for RWY 23L/R departures| though I'm not sure whether it's the best spot. I'm also not sure how happy KIND security would be with me cruising around the perimeter road. (Final spot doesn't have to be on the airport grounds.)

Naturally| I'll check ATIS and METAR for whichever day I manage to get out there and perhaps adjust from there. But I know down at some of my other ""home"" airports there are dedicated spots for hobbyists with too much time on their hands| which offer great views of approaches.

Any help or tips would be appreciated! TIA. Otherwise the plan is the cell-phone lot and driving around a little.

Carriage house / Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) with rooftop deck,"Hello Hoosiers|

I recently purchased a home in Fountain Square and I would like to get everyone's thoughts on this. I'm looking to build an Carriage house or ADU over a garage and to make this a bit special| I'm thinking about having a rooftop deck on top. Proper drainage for the roof would be designed and applied. Not sure if we would have decking material on top of the roof membrane| this is something that will be discussed with the contractor. The unit will be used as a rental| and in the future if I need the space| I would take it back for my own use.

But| I have a couple concerns:

First. Safety. Being it is on the third floor| if someone is to fall or something is to fall| I'm creating a risk by giving renters the chance of something happening.

Second. Neighbors may feel their privacy is lost(?). I personally would not feel this way| but I'm afraid I may create some tension with my neighbors once they notice our rooftop deck| especially since I just moved in and dont really know anyone yet. The home did not come with a garage and so we would like to get this built asap.

How I plan to combat this: Regarding the safety concern| I believe I can minimize this issue by only allowing access to the roof via a spiral staircase. Makes it harder to bring furniture or large items up to the roof without consent. I wouldn't want flying furniture on a windy day. Also| I don't plan on using this ADU as a short term rental. Hoping with a long term tenant| they would be more cautious of using the deck. The issue with neighbors| no clue. I've seen other homes with third floor balconies before| so this shouldn't be too out of the ordinary.

What is everyone's thoughts| is this something you think you would enjoy if you are a renter? And if you are the neighbor of someone who has this| what would you be thinking? Discussions Please. Thanks all

Crisis Center Type Recommendations Needed,"Hi| I might be exiting a relationship today| and I’m worried about keeping myself safe from myself (depending on how it goes).

**Is there somewhere to go if I’m thinking of self-harming where they won’t admit me involuntarily?**

I’ve applied for HIP and I’m waiting but I had to cut off sessions with my therapist and psychiatrist until HIP starts.  I have enough bipolar meds to last a month or two and don’t expect to run out before HIP but if I do| I have a taper off plan to avoid the psychotic episode that happens if you drop off without dosing down. While typing this| I found a friend who can keep me tonight if needed| but if anyone knows any options for me going forward that are low cost and secular| I would be so appreciative.

Neighborhood Opinion - Claridge Farms / near West Clay Village,"We're looking at possibly moving to the Claridge Farms area in Carmel to a house near the West Clay Village neighborhood from Fletcher Place in downtown. I'm unfamiliar with any of the suburbs| and worried about how we'll fit in so was hoping to crowdsource some opinions on the general vibe. We're a mixed race family with two small children (1 and 3). We loved the idea of the neighborhood because being walkable/bikeable to things is very important to us coming from downtown (and living in chicago for a long time before that). However| I NEVER see people out walking around| and I'm worried that there won't be a lot of other kids their age for them to play with in the neighborhood. We're also a young| liberal and non-religious couple and I don't want our kids to feel out of place for any of those reasons.

Cookie Plugg v Hotboyz,"That Fox segment was corny as hell. Larger cultural issues aside| it just made me want to die of cringe. IMO Hotboyz in Fountain Square is successfully executing on the vibe that Cookie Plugg is going for. There’s definitely a west coast| hip hop theme and while it’s not subtle| it’s way more natural. They accomplished it by building a legitimately cool space and hosting events/partnerships to reinforce their aesthetic.

The purpose of this post is to say that backlash to Cookie Plugg isn’t because Indianapolis is a bunch of overly sensitive social justice warriors like the Cookie Plugg execs are making it out to be. As demonstrated by Hotboyz| there’s a right way to pull off this theme. Cookie Plugg’s not doing it.

Looking for people who resell used purple mattresse,Hi. I'm looking for people that resell used purple mattresses and other boxes mattresses for cheap. A few years ago I got my mattress from a lady who had an antique/resell business on Facebook marketplace. She said that boxes mattress companies like purple| ghost| Casper| etc usually have a trial period where you can try out the mattress and return it for no fee if it doesn't work for you. Most of these are any where from 10 to 60 days. But those companies will resell those returned mattresses to vendors who can then resell them to the public for cheap. I got a king size purple mattress for like $150. And I love it and it's still going strong. I find myself in need of a queen or full sized mattress and would like it to be a purple mattress. I can't find that same woman on Facebook marketplace but am wondering if there are other people connected with that vendor program who do the same thing.

Unimportant Library Question,"It really doesn’t matter| but I’m just curious. I’m a *very* recent Indiana transplant.

I currently live a few blocks from the Central Library. I stopped in for a library card yesterday. (By the way| awesome library you have here; I’m super impressed).

I just put an offer in on a house (awaiting response from seller) and it’s just over the county line in Hendricks County. But it has an Indianapolis address and zip code.

Let’s say I move there or to a similar home that is right on the line. Do I switch to a Hendricks County library card or does it go by zip code?

I’ve been in this situation before in another state and I lucked out and qualified for cards in both counties because the county I lived in went by street address and the neighboring county went strictly by zip code. Then the post office changed their route a few years later and my zip code changed| and I lost access to the other library for a couple years until the two systems enacted a reciprocal agreement.

I do know I’ll be able to purchase a library card if I lose eligibility| so that’s an option if it makes sense; but I am just randomly curious about it. I’ll still be working downtown so the Central Library would continue to be my most convenient one.

Meatless and Keto Restaurant Recommendation,"My family always goes out somewhere when it's one of our birthdays. I don't eat meat and that in itself has never been an issue. Since January though| my dad and brother are on keto diets| so I'm looking for a recommendation on restaurants where we can all get something decent to eat together. My brother also does not eat beef.

I do milk| eggs| and cheese not just meat. Looking for something where I actually can eat something interesting and not just a black bean burger or mushroom burger. We live on the east side but are happy to travel anywhere in or around the city.

I want to be clear that I'm hoping there's something serving interesting vegetarian or vegan food alongside meat options for my keto family.

Homeless with 2 dogs ,"As the title states| I’m currently homeless with 2 dogs.

For a little back story| I (24F) was evicted from my apartment back in March 2023 after my DV relationship ended. I stayed with family for a while but that came to an end. I’ve been living in my car with my 2 dogs for about 3 months. All of their needs are being met| I’m just having a hard time finding housing with an eviction so recent on my record (not complaining| I fully understand I got myself into this situation| still sucks though).

That brings me to today. It’s getting warmer outside and the AC went out in my car about 2 years ago. Keeping them through the summer is just not an option. I’ve applied to the section 8 waitlist but it can take up to 24 months. I’m working but not as much as I want because I can’t leave the dogs unattended in the heat for too long. I’m afraid I’ve come to a fork in the road and I need to make some big decisions soon. Either find temporary housing for them or surrender them. I’ve already applied to SOAR (Indiana’s homeless pet program) but they are so overwhelmed with demand they never got back to me the 2 times that I applied.

I guess I’m here asking if anyone knows of any other similar resources? I’ve tried various shelters but no luck. I’m not quite sure what to do from here.

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!

Debt/Collections Lawyers??  Please Help....,"I'm in desperate need of a lawyer that can handle my false collections case....I have asked for proof of my debt in writing via certified mail to an address that is listed on their BBB account.

Turns out| they've changed their address 4 times it seems since 4 different locations (2 BBB| 1 Experian| 1 Transunion) show different addresses in different cities.  I sent this out on the 22nd of April| and it's the 16th of May.  Track the postage and turns out it's back en route to me since I'm assuming this address isn't even real.

I've submitted BBB Claims stating these things| then requesting validity/verification of debt| and all they do is provide me an old lease and nothing stating they own this debt and no acknowledgment from myself or anything in writing by me in ties with them.

This is originally from an old apartment complex in Denver that is no longer in Business anymore and they appeared to disappear from the map (bankruptcy most likely).

All of this is extremely shady and honestly| this along has ruined most of my adult life and if I don't get this solved now I don't know what to do.

I can't even get a new place for rent cause of these scumbags since it appears that I owe them a 5 figure amount for som b/s.

I thought with me going through these channels would be able to build my case and provide the MOST documents to an apartment complex| but all these shady place use A.I (realpage) to screw us over more and don't have a heartbeart internally or just don't care.

I am at the place now that this has caused me so much distress over the last 3+ years that I want to litigate this and get a resolution.

Anyone able to help?  I don't have much funds but I have nothing else to do and have lost hope....I'm praying for a friend.

Buyer Realtor's Fees in Indy,"For people who work in real estate or who have bought a house **very** recently: What are the typical buyer's agent commissions in Indy| with the recent legal changes? I'm looking to buy my first house and trying to make sense of things.

Six months ago| the answer would have been ""don't worry about it| the sellers pay the realtor's fee|"" but with the recent federal price fixing settlement| that's no longer guaranteed.  I like a particular realtor but they want a 3.5% commission and an exclusivity contract for a full year. The 3.5% is guaranteed| and if the seller doesn't pay all of it| I have to pay it. I want my agent to get paid| of course| but this strikes me as too high and **way** too long of a contract if the high commission is a barrier when I make offers. Am I off base?

I have a wedding in Greenfield this summer and will stay 2 1/2 additional days to explore your great city.  Arriving and departing by air.  With apologies if these are too srandard| I have a couple of questions:

* Should I rent a car or just Uber/transit around?  I don't like driving and do like craft beer but am wondering about transportation cost| esp. between the city and Greenfield.  Is it ridiculous without a car or is transit decent?  Is cycling a death wish or is renting a bike a good way to explore?

* Where should I stay that's about half way between Greenfield and the airport?  Google tells me that Fountain Square is cool but they only have one hotel?  For context I'm a mid-30s mildly hipster stereotype man.

* I think WNBA is my best bet for a pro sports game?  Does the stadium have a good vibe?  Or is there a minor league team that's more fun?

Are there any advantages of the mayors proposed location for an MLS team to the current eleven park location that was paused?,"I have been trying to read up on it| but there doesn't seem to be much of the mayors plan out there I can find| besides a location and a closed door conversation with the MLS commissioner.  His proposed location to also seems like it lacks benefits the other one provides.  Am I missing something?

The current site near Lucas Oil has several pros:

1. Piggy back off and synergize with Lucas Oil and convention center events| facilities| and investments due to proximity.  Will also benefit the white river park trails and zoo due to hotels| apartments| and restaurants.

2. The current Eleven Park plans are already made with the required MLS bid in mind. They were architected by the same group that has made other MLS stadiums.

3.  There is $0 of taxes| or tax increases going into the current location.

4.  What else would we do with this location which has been vacant and tbh is a bit of an eyesore of the city| just some unusable space along the river.

3. Time frame| this is a big Hispanic wedding and we would like it to go until 12 or so for a full party
4. Food| either would like to bring our own caterers or be able to choose one with ethnic options available for a reasonable price
5. Drinks| ideally would like to supply our own or be able to have a reasonably priced bar service
6. Would ideally like outdoor ceremony and indoor reception but not set on that| just want it to be pretty.
7. Location| due to drinking and family we really need a venue within approx 45 min. Of downtown with maybe being able to do 1hr for the perfect spot
8. To end this is pretty much cost. Everywhere that might fit feels as If it's going to be 10k+ and we're barely middle class. I want to be able to give her a beautiful wedding but can't sacrifice finances for it.

Dems Voting Rep In The Primary,"Until this year| I was a firm believer in voting for the actual party you align with in the primary.

I'm a Democrat living in Indiana. My district is always going to vote for Carson. We will inevitably vote in another Republican governor. We'll inevitably vote for a Republican president. My vote often feels incredibly worthless.

But I realized: while I may be voting blue in November| if a Republican is going to inevitably win| I may as well have a say in which Republican even gets to run in November| even if I'm still not going to vote for them.

I'm sure there's flaws in this idea| but it may be worth it for Democrats to continue voting Republican in our primaries. Maybe then it all feels slightly less futile.",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1cnh9bf/dems_voting_rep_in_the_primary/,0

Violence Downtown,"Just a warning and vent about my experience downtown today.

I work on Pennsylvania but park on East street| close to Ohio (free street parking). I only switched to this parking situation recently in order to avoid continuing to pay for parking as I’m saving up money.

Despite all the recent issues downtown| I have never felt unsafe.. until today. I was walking on my break towards my car| around Ohio and Cleveland when I noticed a man standing on the sidewalk with a large knife in hand.
I veered off the straight path of course| because I don’t feel like getting stabbed (crazy I know). And he followed me and seemed to be looking around ensuring no one else was around. I started speeding up and as he did too| I took off around a corner. He must not have seen me because he kept going straight. This was by far the scariest encounter I’ve had| and now that it’s later| I’m scared he could potentially hurt someone. I’m sure that’s the plan.

Any Indy hotel where kids eat free?  And  nearby activities.  ,"We live in brown county.   We’ve had a pretty crappy year. We lost our home in 2022| moved in with family that didn’t treat my children right| moved out immediately and now we are in the process of a new home.

They said they wanted to stay at a “fancy hotel” with a “restaurant| pool and a big bathtub “ and I want to go big for them.    I’d like to find a hotel where kids eat free if that’s even a possibility these days.

So now I’m on a hunt for a great hotel in Indy and find some great activities.  We have a children museum membership so we waited to do that and something else.    A big stay with a fun itinerary.    Even tho I’ve lived here my entire life I haven’t spent that much time downtown

Fire Pit - Fire rules,"I live in SE Indy and was looking to build a small fire pit in my backyard for campfire/social activities.

""Marion County residents are allowed to burn only dried twigs or limbs and branches that originate from their property for disposal purposes""

Later on though under 'Open burning types allowed':

    * Cooking fires such as barbecue grills
    * Campfires| patio fire pits| or chimenea
    * Ceremonial bonfires conducted by established groups such as schools| churches| or other recognized organizations
    * Personal comfort fires

Each of those four types aren't for disposal purposes only. And within the rules ""Burn only between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m."" - is that right? No camp fires in the evening/night?

Ritz Charles exclusive wedding venues - will it cost an arm and a leg?,"Hi| my (27F) fiance (31M) and I are getting married October 2025 with a total $20k budget. We are very fortunate to be receiving help from both our parents| are crafty with DIY projects| and prefer minimalist decor anyway. But at the same time| we're not trying to put too much on our plate over the next year and a half.

We want to throw a non-traditional| laid-back wedding with about 100 guests| and we're looking in Indy because we live here and my fiance grew up here| as well as the northern Indiana/SW Michigan area because that's where I grew up. We've only toured one venue in Harbor Country| MI| and it definitely set the bar. It was a craftsman-style| historic inn that used to be an artist residency. The ceremony space is a wooded backyard with a lovely pond| and the reception space is a cozy ballroom with tons of dark wood and a fireplace - but not rustic. We're looking at venues that have a similar vibe: outdoorsy| but not rustic| historic charm that wouldn't clash with more modern design| cozy kind of feeling.

The venues that check those boxes here in Indy all seem to be Ritz Charles venues; specifically The Bluffs at Conner Prairie| the Central Library| and Artisan Acres. Aesthetically| Artisan Acres is as dreamy as it gets| but I was able to find average pricing| including the venue and everything that would be provided by Ritz Charles. I like the idea of an all-inclusive vendor| but the price was pretty much our entire budget at an estimated $175-$200 a head. We wouldn't have enough for a photographer (the one vendor I am so willing to splurge on)| music| or decor - even if DIY'd. So that crossed Artisan Acres off the list.

I'm wondering| for those who have experience with these venues| if that's the standard for every Ritz Charles venue| or if Artisan Acres just happens to be one of the most expensive ones? Should I bother looking into these places with the budget we've set?",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1cj9s91/ritz_charles_exclusive_wedding_venues_will_it/,0

Drug Drop,"A scary thing happened today. I work from home and got a notification that UPS dropped off a package and rang my doorbell. I quickly ran downstairs to grab it.

Called the police and the cops got to my address within about 15 mins. We weren’t expecting any packages nor was our neighbor. Police identified the car as a lengthy enterprise rental. They said that what had likely happened was a drug drop. Our neighbor is selling his side of the duplex and those fuckers probably thought the entire property wasn’t occupied.

Dog Trainer specializing in Leash Reactivity in Indianapolis,I have never made a post like this before but I am at my wits end and need help finding a legitimate dog trainer specializing in leash reactivity. My dog Maya is around 5 years old and I got her when she was around 1. She was previously a stray and I don’t know much about her life before I got her. She’s overall a really sweet girl and has no issues off leash with cats and dogs of different sizes and breeds but when she’s on the leash she is very reactive. She will bark and lunge at dogs across the street and really anywhere in her vicinity. I previously did a 2 week Board and Train program with The Dog Wizard about a year ago and they gave me a prong collar to help with her pulling issues but it hasn’t helped with the leash reactivity at all. I try positive reinforcement methods on my own but once she spots another dog I am having a hard time getting her to focus on me. I am really seeking any recommendations of dog trainers in downtown Indianapolis that know how to handle leash reactive dogs and can help me to understand why she’s so reactive and also to help me train her. My boyfriend has even said he doesn’t think she will ever get better but I can’t accept that so if anyone can give me recommendations of trainers I would really appreciate it!,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1cbx7wh/dog_trainer_specializing_in_leash_reactivity_in/,0

Things to Do in NYC: June 2024 Edition,"Every month I assemble the “[Blankman List](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/p/things-to-do-in-nyc-june-2024)|” which includes a wide range of events happening in New York City for every day of the month. In the free highlights below| I focus in on one part of June in NYC: Pride—a month for honoring people who are LGBTQIA+. After all| it’s local history; pride month commemorates the[ 1969 Stonewall Uprising in NYC](https://www.loc.gov/lgbt-pride-month/about/).

The citywide culmination of Pride is the [June 30 march down 5th Avenue](https://www.nycpride.org/event/nyc-pride-march)| but you have my full sympathy if cramming your way into the sidelines of a packed Manhattan parade isn’t your thing. (Though the events below includes a few similar options if it is!)

Pride is bigger than a parade. It is a chance to recognize and honor that people are not all cut from the same cloth. So for one month| I offer a variety of events to honor people along all the colors of the rainbow. Here is [May’s free events](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1bxduxk/things_to_do_in_nyc_may_2024_edition/) for the remainder of the month.

*Disclaimer: Before going anywhere| please confirm the date| time| location| cost| and description using the listed website. Any event is at risk of being rescheduled| relocated| sold out| at capacity| or canceled. Costs are rounded to the nearest dollar and may change. I try to vet quality and describe accurately| but I may misjudge. All views are my own.*

# The T of LGBT

It’s impossible for me to ignore the deeply misguided social and political discourse that I sometimes hear around [being transgender](https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbtq/transgender-people-gender-identity-gender-expression). There are plenty of events year-round that tell the stories and elevate the voices of people who are transgender and gender nonconforming. June is the perfect month to make time to hear them.

# Dance and Celebrate

NYC is a premiere world destination to glitter and be gay. With its star-studded| blocks-wide festivities| a lot of the celebration around pride involves parades| parties| and dancing.

Walking into New York City Today (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all|

I am currently on day 413 of walking across America with my stroller “Smiley'' after having started up from La Push| WA and now having walked through WA| OR| ID| UT| CO| KS| MO| IL| KY| TN| SC| NC| VA| DC| MD| PA| and am now in Hoboken| NJ. 

Today I’ll be crossing over into Manhattan and into New York City via the George Washington Bridge. After having walked from the Pacific Ocean| NYC will be where I reach the Atlantic| so I’m very HYPED and EXCITED. I technically got Into NYC and New York State via Staten Island yesterday| but I went right back into New Jersey| so today feels like more of the official entrance. If you see me on the way there or around town feel free to say hi.

I’ll be staying up in the upper west side tonight| but I’ll walk on down to Brooklyn and stay there for a few days. 

Like I said before| New York City is actually where I’ll be seeing the Atlantic after having walked all the way from the Pacific. The celebration is planned for 4pm Saturday April 27th at Coney Island beach. It is an open invitation if anyone would like to come| the more the merrier. 

After the celebration| I’m planning to walk from Brooklyn to Rockaway Beach on Monday. Then Tuesday I’ll walk back up to the Upper West Side to stay the night and then proceed Wednesday up to New Haven| CT for the final stop of the walk. 

After New Haven| I’ll head back down to the city to spend a couple of weeks| so always open for recommendations on things to do and see while in town. 

A big part of the reason I am doing the walk is to raise money for AmericaWalks| which is a national pedestrian advocacy and walkability organization. The most dangerous thing I deal with while walking is cars and in that way the advocacy is built into the activity. So if anyone is interested in making America a more walkable place and more pleasant for those outside of cars| I’d highly recommend checking them out at AmericaWalks.org and consider supporting their mission.

I’ve tried to meet with local advocacy groups that focus on walkability| bikeablity| urbanism along the way| so if anyone could help me get connected with them| I’d love the help. (I’m sure there are plenty across NYC) 

Other than that| I am excited to get to New York City. If anyone would like to follow along or learn more| the best place to do that is walk2washington.com or on IG| FB at walkfromwashington (changed the name recently and didn’t want to pay for a new domain name lol).

Thanks|

Things to Do in NYC: May 2024 Edition,"When making these lists each month| I don’t really make a tourist vs. resident divide. The reality is that activities don’t fall neatly into one bucket or the other. Many tourists—anywhere| for that matter—want to do “non-touristy” things that provide a more authentic taste of the city they’re visiting. Residents do “touristy” things| too. New York City has some of the outright best theater in the world| for example. It attracts thousands of tourists *and residents* every week| but sometimes it feels like walking through at least six circles of hell to get there.

Every month I assemble the “[Blankman List](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/)|” a curated list of things to do around the city| with at least one event per day. In the [May 2024 Blankman List](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/p/things-to-do-in-nyc-may-2024)| I pay no mind to how mainstream or underground an event is and include some major bangers like [Mary J. Blige](https://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/strength-of-a-woman-festival-summit-2024)| [Kamasi Washington](https://www.msg.com/calendar/beacon-theatre-may-2024-kamasi-washington/3B00605C81DE0C7B)| and [Belle & Sebastian](https://www.brooklynparamount.com/shows). For the free highlights below| however| there is nary a mega-arena to be found. I zero in on the understated| the esoteric| and the events most unlike typical NYC tourist fare.

Here are [April’s free highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1b9pzf2/things_to_do_in_nyc_april_2024_edition/) for the remainder of the month.

## Contemporary and Experimental Art

I am an eternal advocate for the *living* arts. Painting did not end with Monet. Opera did not end with Verdi. If you’ve never seen an experimental work before| your first instinct might be to cringe or to laugh| and to that I say: *that’s okay*. Screw the gatekeepers who act like they’ve never raised an eyebrow at something really weird. Stay through the end| and you just might walk away with a broader conception of what is possible through art.

* Tuesday| May 7: [Charlotte Mundy: Strange Moving Power](https://www.as-coa.org/events/charlotte-mundy-strange-moving-power)

   * 22 E 60th St| 1st floor (Midtown East| Manhattan)

## Off- and Off-Off-Broadway Theater

Among the hundreds of venues across New York City that aren’t considered Broadway| there is a stunning range of theater happening on any given day: one-person shows| experimental plays| classic revivals| ancient stories| non-English theater| and so on. To the tourist who’s just here for a weekend| my recommendation is typically just to stick to [Broadway](https://bwayrush.com/). But to anyone who has the time or inclination| this city offers much| much more than *The Lion King* and *Wicked*!

* Saturday| May 4–Sunday| May 19: [Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical](https://www.galleryplayers.com/)

   * La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club| The Downstairs
   * 66 E 4th St| basement level (Bowery| Manhattan)

## Art House and Indie Film Screenings

I sing a lot of praises about this city| though there’s no question that cinephiles will find their homecoming in Los Angeles| not New York City. That said| NYC is still a major film hub| with endless opportunities to see films that are indie| foreign| short| experimental| or otherwise tough to find elsewhere at a public screening.

* Thursday| May 2—Thursday| May 9: [Wildcat](https://www.angelikafilmcenter.com/nyc/movies/details/wildcat)

## Events Outside Manhattan and Brooklyn

New York City comprises five boroughs| each of which used to be its own city. Manhattan is the behemoth| with hundreds of imposing skyscrapers. Brooklyn is still an outer borough| to be sure; however| it is the most populous one and is heavily represented throughout my [monthly list](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/). Yet that still leaves out three boroughs and millions of residents! Everyone in NYC is just just a subway (and in the case of Staten Island| ferry) ride away from thousands of restaurants| event venues| and art spaces with hardly a tourist in sight.

## University Events Open to the Public

I particularly recommend checking out performances from some of the city’s world class conservatories| such as Juilliard and the Manhattan School of Music.

A few more random things to do/see in Houston,"Houston| you’ve surprised me yet again. (I moved from CA| then lived in TX on & off for about 6-7 years & now live in a completely different state from the two). I try to visit my family every 1-2 months| but of course they work Mon-Fri & although I’m gracing them with my presence they still must work; I periodically go gallivanting solo as often as the mosquitoes let me roam.   

I’ve never been to this part of town| although I’ve been a block over to see a show at the theatre & I used to work at Live! At Bayou! up until it closed.  But today was the first time I’ve walked through/seen the Heritage Society area| the park here & thanks to Reddit comments| the beautiful original library which is now known as the Julia Ideson Building. Theres a gorgeous reading room (perfect if you’re still studying!) & a random brick archive across from it.   

Whether you’re visiting & looking for something to do or relax in/at| or you line here & didn’t know it existed… hopefully you get to check out any of the above anytime soon!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cr5x8h,0
Always Free Things To Do In Houston (let's make a thread about it),"What other ones do y'all know about? It could be credit card/debit card benefits| could be special programs| could be special days of the month/week places have free admission. I'm trying to save us all some money

Looking for a few recommendations; antique shops| boutiques| record stores| markets/pop ups| etc,"I'm in Houston for the weekend with my wife and we are trying to figure out a few more things to do later today and tomorrow| we are staying in Montrose so nearby places would be preferred| but we are open to driving a bit. 

What we are most after are antique/vintage shops| we enjoy finding nice little knickknacks for the house| vintage clothing| and furniture (we got the SUV with us thankfully). 

As far as record stores| I love Houston Rap (Z Ro| DJ Screw| Scarface| UGK| the whole SUC| etc) and old school latino music (boleros| corridos| cumbia) so any shops that specialize in these genders would be great| but if not| anything with a good hip hop| indie/alt rock| and jazz collection would be nice. 

As far as markets or pop ups| we're really just trying to get a taste of local restaurants/food vendors| artists| local businesses| etc. Ideally something with a mix of different cultures; Latinos| Blacks| Asians| even white people have their cool shit (please don’t take this seriously lol)
