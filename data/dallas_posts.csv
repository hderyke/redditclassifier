Rec Sports Leagues,Anyone know of any rec sports organizations that play at a decent halfway point between North Dallas and Fort Worth? Searching this online was far harder than I expected as all Arlington leagues appear to be in South Arlington. Any sport but with a focus on softball| basketball and football. Must be coed. I am building a team but have people in both cities.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/4f8km4/rec_sports_leagues/,1
Looking for a safish bike route around dallas,So i'm relatively new to Dallas and coming to realize you don't have a lot of rec sports in the summer|  so i'm trying to get in some biking and looking for a good loop.  i currently live near bishop arts but kinda want to explore more of the city with a pretty big loop (10mi loop would be cool).  ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/4rqubz/looking_for_a_safish_bike_route_around_dallas/,0
Dodgeball League in Dallas,"I started an adult dodgeball league in Dallas at the beginning of the year and would love for everyone to come out and join in on the fun!


Currently we're just doing Tuesday night Open Gyms| but I hope to start league/team play once we gain a large enough following to fill out a solid amount of teams. 

Open Gyms take place every Tuesday from 7-9pm at Fretz Rec Center off Belt Line and Hillcrest.

Format: We split the group of players into two teams playground style| with 2 captains handpicking their teams. We switch up teams about every 20 minutes or so.

We're an affiliate of a league out of California called Elite Dodgeball| and am extremely excited to be expanding the sport in the Dallas area!

So| if you're wanting to have an insane amount of fun| I encourage you and your buddies to come out and play with us on Tuesday nights!

Which DFW Kickball League is the best?,"I just moved here and wanted to join a league or something (ANYTHING) to meet new people and have an excuse to leave my house consistency and have a few new drinking buddies. 

I saw on reddit a couple of recommendations but no clear direction on which is the best one. I know you might ask| ""best in terms of what?"". Well| I don't know the answer to that. I guess most organized? Most participation? Who knows| the best. 

I think the ones with the most recs were GOkickball Dallas and Lonestart Sports and Social.

Moving to Dallas at the end of July,"I'm moving to Dallas at the end of July and was hoping I could get in touch
with some people here on Reddit to break the ice before actually living there.

So a couple of things about myself. I work in IT for US Bank and will be working
from home after the move so it's going to be hard for me to meet new people in 
the office since I won't have that environment. My girlfriend will be an office
manager in Dallas and this is the main reason for the move. We're both into
sports (mainly baseball for me)| I watch anime here and there| and would like to
meet some people that are into rec activities. We're both really down to earth
and chill so if this sounds like some people you'd like to get to know hit me up.

Thanks and hopefully will get to meet some of you at the end of July.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/39y668/moving_to_dallas_at_the_end_of_july/,1

Newby Here,"Hey Guys--

I'm brand new to the area (4 months).  We moved from the north| so winter has been incredible so far.  It seems like we can drive fifteen minutes in any direction and find something to do.  The only bad thing is that it's literally just us.  No relatives| no friends that are already here| etc.

So I want to get us involved in some groups--professional groups| intramural sports| churches (thought I'm not religious--it's important to her--Methodist or non-denominational)| etc.  I'm open to any ideas you may have.  She's a teacher and I'm in business.  I love hockey (playing or watching--ice| roller| floor| etc.) and professional/self-development.  She loves cats and watching TV.

I'm also looking for a nearby gym that doesn't cost an arm and a leg--preferably somewhere we can both join for cheap.

Any and all ideas for us are welcomed.  I really appreciate the help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/2sjmfw/newby_here/,1
Intramural / League (or similar) sports?,"I loved playing intramurals in college. Now that I've graduated| I sadly can't do that anymore. I'm just looking for some form of leagues around here. 

Specifically| I'm looking for flag-football| soccer| or basketball. However| the other issue is that I don't have a big enough group to make a team. Any leagues around here that take individuals? I'd be okay with that or maybe pickups / meetups for this kind of stuff?

Thanks in advance - this community has helped me quite a bit around here since coming back from college.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/2sb86i/intramural_league_or_similar_sports/,1
UTA Hockey,"Hi Everyone!
Many of you most likely have no idea| but yes| UTA does in fact have a hockey team (ACHA DIV II). I am not surprised this is an unknown| because we are a club team. Which means no funding AT ALL from UTA itself. In addition to the nonexistent funding| there is no ""scouting"" or recruitment other than the players themselves reaching out to students (kind of like this).

I have been approved to start a team 'Member Planet' account for donations. The site is very detailed| so I am still working on it| but I do a foundation set.

Below is the link to the 'Member Planet' page. https://www.memberplanet.com/utaicehockeyclub
I| as a player of the UTA Hockey Club am asking for ANY help or aid you may provide. Help could be as simple as forwarding this post to a person you know who plays hockey or is looking to join. Help could be donating $2 to the team. Help could be reposting this on your twitter/facebook/Instagram. Help can come in a lot of ways| but it is also very limited without the participation of caring individuals. I am asking for someone to care and support the team| as we care and support our school.

Please feel free to PM me for any questions or ideas.
On behalf of the UTA Hockey Club; Thank for for even reading this! Go Mavs!!!

-Bobby
