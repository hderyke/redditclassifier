Seeking new friends ,"I'm trying to put myself out there and look for some new friends. First I'd like to ask if there are already other resources available that might be better platforms to find friends. I've done some browsing on Meetup| but I've felt really hesitant about the events I've seen on there. But if anyone knows of other better platforms| I would be interested.

That being said I'll also just tell you a little about myself to see if anyone who reads this might be interested.

I am a late 20s man. I went to college here in Indy| got my BS in a hard science| and I've been working here since graduating. Recently married to a woman. We currently live in Irvington. And I've been trying recently to better myself and putting myself out there to find new friends is just one of the many things on that list.

I like playing games of all kinds; video games| table tops| D&D| card games and I'm willing to try /learn new games. I am not very competitive and so I would be looking for something pretty friendly. I enjoy video games mostly for a good narrative. Not much of an online gamer.

I am not very athletic these days| but I would be willing to try some friendly sports or other outdoor activities. I don't currently go to a gym but I could be convinced of being a gym accountability buddy or something like that. Just understand that I would be starting from couch potato level for any of this. But I'm willing to try

I love lots of different types of food. Very willing to try lots of different cultures. Love cooking with my wife and sharing a good meal amongst friends. I can appreciate a good beer

I appreciate a fairly wide variety of music. Definitely enjoyed going to the Wonder Road festival in Garfield Park the last two years. I haven't been there a lot| but I think the Hi-Fi is a cool venue and would be interested in seeing more bands there.

I like VERY casually watching sports and not taking it seriously. I'm not ever the one you should ask about specific teams or players.

And just to keep this as open ended as possible| I'm willing to hear suggestions of other activities.

I would be interested in a commitment of meeting up once every 1 - 3 weeks. Very flexible around that number. Definitely don't need a super heavy commitment from anybody| especially starting out. Let me know if any of this sounds good to you.

Just a dude who is learning to love himself a little more. Thanks for reading ",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1d1icpz/seeking_new_friends/,1

Dog Rescues - help re-homing my brother’s aggressive dog,"Hi all|

I’ll try and be concise. My brother and his ex fiancé adopted a dog together that they didn’t train and honestly barely took care of. When she left| she left the dog as his responsibility (she’s chipped to his ex| she wanted the dog).

He board and trained her with a reputable trainer who said she was fine under his care| taught him the tools| etc. but the same behaviors returned once he was home. Im not sure how consistent he was in actually using these tools though (I don’t live with him as we are both adults).

I think it’s hard for him to admit| but he realizes now he’s not equipped to train or take care of her the way she needs. I also think he’s having a hard time with this information and not exploring all options.

They are talking about euthanasia as the next step.

Please only reply with helpful comments. Do not post judgement on my brother| it’s absolutely no excuse but this is where he is at| I’m doing my best to help find a way to re-home her over euthanasia. I do think in the right setting with someone who is equipped to train her| she could be a great companion.

She is a large-ish black lab mixed with maybe some type of hound? She is like a lab but a bit more lanky| black with a white strip on her belly. She does have bite history.

Thanks in advance for any advice. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1d1cm0x/dog_rescues_help_rehoming_my_brothers_aggressive/,0

Aggressive dogs. Worried about retaliation if I call animal control. ,"What would you do?
There are people in my neighborhood with 2 aggressive German Shepherds. I jog and walk around the neighborhood. Yesterday| the 2 dogs charged me in the street. They kept chasing me as I backed away and yelled at them. They were showing teeth| barking| and looking for an opportunity to lunge at me. An owner kept calling them and finally got them to come. She just said “sorry about that.” I said “there are kids in this neighborhood.” Including my 3 year old that I walk with. She just turned her back to me| kind of put a dismissive hand in the air and said “I know.”
Today| I was running again. I had thick branch this time just in case. The dogs were out again. There was a different owner. The dogs growled but they didn’t charge me this time. The owner kind of stared at me and just waved me on like even though I was running I was lingering and inconveniencing him.
I really want to contact the authorities| because after yesterday| it’s obvious these dogs are territorial and they will attack people on the street. Myself and a lot of my neighbors walk around| including kids and other pets. These people obviously don’t care about their dogs being loose and being aggressive with strangers. My concern is them retaliating even though they are clearly in the wrong.

Moving to Indy - 220 Meridian query and general luxury apartment recommendations,"Hi there! I am due to move to Indy in about 3 months time from overseas and I was wondering if anyone here could advise on their thoughts on apartments.

I am hoping to get a 2 bed apartment and have a budget up to about $2800 or so - but I could maybe push it a bit if I had somewhere I really wanted.

I was looking at 220 meridian - and it obviously looks amazing. What are people’s thoughts? I have been trying to work out what fees there are (utilities| trash| parking etc.) - does anyone know what they are? I have no pets so that one is fine.

The only downside of 220 Meridian for me is not having a balcony - I note there is a little window that can be cracked open in most of the apartments it seems. How have people found them? Do you miss the air circulation? Does it get very hot in the summer with the glass?

Lastly (sorry for all the questions!)| I am moving to Indy on my own as a female in my early 30s. So I was also hoping to find somewhere that organised community events or opportunities to meet new people. Is 220 any good for that| or does anyone have other recommendations?

If you know him| explain to him that he may ruin someone’s life WHEN they hit him for doing nothing wrong.  That’s all. Rant over. But seriously| if you know him| please knock some sense into him.
The picture is what the bike looks like.

Underground Explosion and House Shaking,"All| I have lived in Indy since 2017 close to 96th and Allisonville in the Castelton area.  Ever since I started working from home during COVID| randomly during business hours/days| I will hear something that sounds like an explosion underground then my whole house shakes.  It just happened today again 5/24/2024 at 3:50pm EDT.

It has drove me nuts for years and I would really like to get to the bottom of it because today was rough enough that windows chattered from shaking and one of these days it is going to do some damage.

My hypothesis is that it has something to do with the Martin Marietta North Indianapolis Mine just a couple miles North West of my house.  It is the only thing that makes logical sense to me.  It only happens during week days and business hours.  It happens maybe once a week at most.  It is not large trucks on the street or low flying jets.  I have been outside many times and experienced this| you can feel the ground shake under your feet right after you hear the rumble.

Anyone have any ideas on what this is or who I could reach out to?

Recommendations for Plane-Spotting at KIND?,"Hello| r/Indianapolis| from a frequent traveler to your fine city. And also from a guy who enjoys aviation.

Next week I'm in town on business| and I'll have a big chunk of time to kill and decided (weather permitting) I'd like to just prop up somewhere for an afternoon and watch arrivals and departures at KIND. Do any other aviation enthusiasts recommend a good spot for setting up a camp chair| tuning into KIND tower and traffic| pulling up my charts on Navigraph for study and tracking arrivals and departures on live radar| and relaxing and eating sandwiches? (I'm mostly interested in watching jetliners.)

I've only spent minimal time in the cell-phone waiting lot| which seems pretty nicely set up for RWY 23L/R departures| though I'm not sure whether it's the best spot. I'm also not sure how happy KIND security would be with me cruising around the perimeter road. (Final spot doesn't have to be on the airport grounds.)

Naturally| I'll check ATIS and METAR for whichever day I manage to get out there and perhaps adjust from there. But I know down at some of my other ""home"" airports there are dedicated spots for hobbyists with too much time on their hands| which offer great views of approaches.

Any help or tips would be appreciated! TIA. Otherwise the plan is the cell-phone lot and driving around a little.

(P.S.| I know Indy has many| many other fun ways to kill time; I very much like Indy and have done a lot there! This is for bespoke time-killing.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1cznfom/recommendations_for_planespotting_at_kind/,0

Carriage house / Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) with rooftop deck,"Hello Hoosiers|

I recently purchased a home in Fountain Square and I would like to get everyone's thoughts on this. I'm looking to build an Carriage house or ADU over a garage and to make this a bit special| I'm thinking about having a rooftop deck on top. Proper drainage for the roof would be designed and applied. Not sure if we would have decking material on top of the roof membrane| this is something that will be discussed with the contractor. The unit will be used as a rental| and in the future if I need the space| I would take it back for my own use.

But| I have a couple concerns:

First. Safety. Being it is on the third floor| if someone is to fall or something is to fall| I'm creating a risk by giving renters the chance of something happening.

Second. Neighbors may feel their privacy is lost(?). I personally would not feel this way| but I'm afraid I may create some tension with my neighbors once they notice our rooftop deck| especially since I just moved in and dont really know anyone yet. The home did not come with a garage and so we would like to get this built asap.

How I plan to combat this: Regarding the safety concern| I believe I can minimize this issue by only allowing access to the roof via a spiral staircase. Makes it harder to bring furniture or large items up to the roof without consent. I wouldn't want flying furniture on a windy day. Also| I don't plan on using this ADU as a short term rental. Hoping with a long term tenant| they would be more cautious of using the deck. The issue with neighbors| no clue. I've seen other homes with third floor balconies before| so this shouldn't be too out of the ordinary.

What is everyone's thoughts| is this something you think you would enjoy if you are a renter? And if you are the neighbor of someone who has this| what would you be thinking? Discussions Please. Thanks all

Crisis Center Type Recommendations Needed,"Hi| I might be exiting a relationship today| and I’m worried about keeping myself safe from myself (depending on how it goes).

**Are there non-religious crisis centers?**

**Is there somewhere to go if I’m thinking of self-harming where they won’t admit me involuntarily?**

While I would actually love to be admitted into an inpatient program| I can’t make that commitment at this time because I have shared custody of my child.  I don’t want the child cared for full time by the other parent| and I don’t want my parental rights threatened because of my mental health.

Pertinent info: I’m not actively suicidal in this moment| no ideation.  But ideation and some planning have taken place at different times in the last 6 months.  I’ve had lots of ideation throughout my life on and off but I’ve never made an attempt.  I have **no health insurance** right now because I lost my job last month.  I’ve applied for HIP and I’m waiting but I had to cut off sessions with my therapist and psychiatrist until HIP starts.  I have enough bipolar meds to last a month or two and don’t expect to run out before HIP but if I do| I have a taper off plan to avoid the psychotic episode that happens if you drop off without dosing down. While typing this| I found a friend who can keep me tonight if needed| but if anyone knows any options for me going forward that are low cost and secular| I would be so appreciative.

We loved the idea of the neighborhood because being walkable/bikeable to things is very important to us coming from downtown (and living in chicago for a long time before that). However| I NEVER see people out walking around| and I'm worried that there won't be a lot of other kids their age for them to play with in the neighborhood. We're also a young| liberal and non-religious couple and I don't want our kids to feel out of place for any of those reasons.

Anyone happen to know anything about Claridge Farms neighborhood demographics and if we'll be able to find friends? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1cy96sa/neighborhood_opinion_claridge_farms_near_west/,0

Out of towner for Rock the Ruins,"Hey all| tried looking in the sub and the Rock the Ruins website  but still a little confused.

I’m driving in from Columbus| OH tomorrow to see Decemberists at Rock the Ruins. This is my first time at this event and I love the band  so I bought a Gold add on. From reading it sounds like there’s a specific entrance for upgrades. Is there a special area for upgrades to sit / bring chairs or is it just the entrance and you set up shop anywhere with the general admission people? Doors open at 5 so is it a mad dash then or can I wander in at say 6ish and still find a good spot?

Looking for people who resell used purple mattresse,Hi. I'm looking for people that resell used purple mattresses and other boxes mattresses for cheap. A few years ago I got my mattress from a lady who had an antique/resell business on Facebook marketplace. She said that boxes mattress companies like purple| ghost| Casper| etc usually have a trial period where you can try out the mattress and return it for no fee if it doesn't work for you. Most of these are any where from 10 to 60 days. But those companies will resell those returned mattresses to vendors who can then resell them to the public for cheap. I got a king size purple mattress for like $150. And I love it and it's still going strong. I find myself in need of a queen or full sized mattress and would like it to be a purple mattress. I can't find that same woman on Facebook marketplace but am wondering if there are other people connected with that vendor program who do the same thing.

Unimportant Library Question,"It really doesn’t matter| but I’m just curious. I’m a *very* recent Indiana transplant.

I currently live a few blocks from the Central Library. I stopped in for a library card yesterday. (By the way| awesome library you have here; I’m super impressed).

I just put an offer in on a house (awaiting response from seller) and it’s just over the county line in Hendricks County. But it has an Indianapolis address and zip code.

Let’s say I move there or to a similar home that is right on the line. Do I switch to a Hendricks County library card or does it go by zip code?

I’ve been in this situation before in another state and I lucked out and qualified for cards in both counties because the county I lived in went by street address and the neighboring county went strictly by zip code. Then the post office changed their route a few years later and my zip code changed| and I lost access to the other library for a couple years until the two systems enacted a reciprocal agreement.

I do know I’ll be able to purchase a library card if I lose eligibility| so that’s an option if it makes sense; but I am just randomly curious about it. I’ll still be working downtown so the Central Library would continue to be my most convenient one.

Homeless with 2 dogs ,"As the title states| I’m currently homeless with 2 dogs.

For a little back story| I (24F) was evicted from my apartment back in March 2023 after my DV relationship ended. I stayed with family for a while but that came to an end. I’ve been living in my car with my 2 dogs for about 3 months. All of their needs are being met| I’m just having a hard time finding housing with an eviction so recent on my record (not complaining| I fully understand I got myself into this situation| still sucks though).

That brings me to today. It’s getting warmer outside and the AC went out in my car about 2 years ago. Keeping them through the summer is just not an option. I’ve applied to the section 8 waitlist but it can take up to 24 months. I’m working but not as much as I want because I can’t leave the dogs unattended in the heat for too long. I’m afraid I’ve come to a fork in the road and I need to make some big decisions soon. Either find temporary housing for them or surrender them. I’ve already applied to SOAR (Indiana’s homeless pet program) but they are so overwhelmed with demand they never got back to me the 2 times that I applied.

I guess I’m here asking if anyone knows of any other similar resources? I’ve tried various shelters but no luck. I’m not quite sure what to do from here.

Any advice is appreciated! Thank you!

Big Plane Over Indy,"I was just driving back from Fishers into Carmel and saw an absolutely massive plane in the sky not high off the ground. I mean massive. Had to pull over to look at it. So we checked the flight aware and it was this flight. Came in from Hungary via Sweden and Iceland.

Debt/Collections Lawyers??  Please Help....,"I'm in desperate need of a lawyer that can handle my false collections case....I have asked for proof of my debt in writing via certified mail to an address that is listed on their BBB account.

Turns out| they've changed their address 4 times it seems since 4 different locations (2 BBB| 1 Experian| 1 Transunion) show different addresses in different cities.  I sent this out on the 22nd of April| and it's the 16th of May.  Track the postage and turns out it's back en route to me since I'm assuming this address isn't even real.

I've submitted BBB Claims stating these things| then requesting validity/verification of debt| and all they do is provide me an old lease and nothing stating they own this debt and no acknowledgment from myself or anything in writing by me in ties with them.

This is originally from an old apartment complex in Denver that is no longer in Business anymore and they appeared to disappear from the map (bankruptcy most likely).

All of this is extremely shady and honestly| this along has ruined most of my adult life and if I don't get this solved now I don't know what to do.

I can't even get a new place for rent cause of these scumbags since it appears that I owe them a 5 figure amount for som b/s.

I thought with me going through these channels would be able to build my case and provide the MOST documents to an apartment complex| but all these shady place use A.I (realpage) to screw us over more and don't have a heartbeart internally or just don't care.

I am at the place now that this has caused me so much distress over the last 3+ years that I want to litigate this and get a resolution.

Anyone able to help?  I don't have much funds but I have nothing else to do and have lost hope....I'm praying for a friend.

Buyer Realtor's Fees in Indy,"For people who work in real estate or who have bought a house **very** recently: What are the typical buyer's agent commissions in Indy| with the recent legal changes? I'm looking to buy my first house and trying to make sense of things.

Six months ago| the answer would have been ""don't worry about it| the sellers pay the realtor's fee|"" but with the recent federal price fixing settlement| that's no longer guaranteed.  I like a particular realtor but they want a 3.5% commission and an exclusivity contract for a full year. The 3.5% is guaranteed| and if the seller doesn't pay all of it| I have to pay it. I want my agent to get paid| of course| but this strikes me as too high and **way** too long of a contract if the high commission is a barrier when I make offers. Am I off base? Does the Indy market just traditionally pay much higher fees than average?",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1crpwdl/buyer_realtors_fees_in_indy/,0

Wedding in Greenfield and taking a couple of days to explore,"Hello great people of Indianapolis!

I have a wedding in Greenfield this summer and will stay 2 1/2 additional days to explore your great city.  Arriving and departing by air.  With apologies if these are too srandard| I have a couple of questions:

* Should I rent a car or just Uber/transit around?  I don't like driving and do like craft beer but am wondering about transportation cost| esp. between the city and Greenfield.  Is it ridiculous without a car or is transit decent?  Is cycling a death wish or is renting a bike a good way to explore?

* Where should I stay that's about half way between Greenfield and the airport?  Google tells me that Fountain Square is cool but they only have one hotel?  For context I'm a mid-30s mildly hipster stereotype man.

* I think WNBA is my best bet for a pro sports game?  Does the stadium have a good vibe?  Or is there a minor league team that's more fun?

Are there any advantages of the mayors proposed location for an MLS team to the current eleven park location that was paused?,"I have been trying to read up on it| but there doesn't seem to be much of the mayors plan out there I can find| besides a location and a closed door conversation with the MLS commissioner.  His proposed location to also seems like it lacks benefits the other one provides.  Am I missing something?

The current site near Lucas Oil has several pros:

1. Piggy back off and synergize with Lucas Oil and convention center events| facilities| and investments due to proximity.  Will also benefit the white river park trails and zoo due to hotels| apartments| and restaurants.

2. The current Eleven Park plans are already made with the required MLS bid in mind. They were architected by the same group that has made other MLS stadiums.

3.  There is $0 of taxes| or tax increases going into the current location.

4.  What else would we do with this location which has been vacant and tbh is a bit of an eyesore of the city| just some unusable space along the river.

Wedding venues ,"Looking for venues in this city feels impossible. I understand that we have a fair amount of requirements but it feels like every venue wants to steal your soul for money.

They had a minimum 12k food cost.... and per person it was 50$ for pork and chicken dishes| no drinks or anything included. If anyone has any ideas of venues that might work for us please please help. Restrictions listed below
1. It's going to be big| likely 200-250 people
2. My mom is ideally making our cake so hopefully no restrictions on that
3. Time frame| this is a big Hispanic wedding and we would like it to go until 12 or so for a full party
4. Food| either would like to bring our own caterers or be able to choose one with ethnic options available for a reasonable price
5. Drinks| ideally would like to supply our own or be able to have a reasonably priced bar service
6. Would ideally like outdoor ceremony and indoor reception but not set on that| just want it to be pretty.
7. Location| due to drinking and family we really need a venue within approx 45 min. Of downtown with maybe being able to do 1hr for the perfect spot
8. To end this is pretty much cost. Everywhere that might fit feels as If it's going to be 10k+ and we're barely middle class. I want to be able to give her a beautiful wedding but can't sacrifice finances for it.

Violence Downtown,"Just a warning and vent about my experience downtown today.

I work on Pennsylvania but park on East street| close to Ohio (free street parking). I only switched to this parking situation recently in order to avoid continuing to pay for parking as I’m saving up money.

Despite all the recent issues downtown| I have never felt unsafe.. until today. I was walking on my break towards my car| around Ohio and Cleveland when I noticed a man standing on the sidewalk with a large knife in hand.
I veered off the straight path of course| because I don’t feel like getting stabbed (crazy I know). And he followed me and seemed to be looking around ensuring no one else was around. I started speeding up and as he did too| I took off around a corner. He must not have seen me because he kept going straight. This was by far the scariest encounter I’ve had| and now that it’s later| I’m scared he could potentially hurt someone. I’m sure that’s the plan.

Advice Needed,"I lease an apartment in a Buckingham Companies community.

We have not been told anything about the risks| including track record of the contractors| what could go wrong during and after the construction| and the repercussions of not signing the waiver. The management team is very difficult to connect with.

I have renters insurance but I highly doubt this scope of liability would be covered by my policy.

I had planned on extending my lease and staying in my apartment for quite a while longer but by virtue of me being in no position to move due to finances| health issues| difficulty in finding available apartments without a waitlist| moving expenses and deposits| etc. I fear being coerced into signing this waiver just so that they won't retaliate and refuse to allow me to renew my lease.

Where to live and what’s up with Speedway schools?,"We’re relocating from out of state for spouse’s job. I work from home. We have teenage kids. Want to stay under 850-900k| need to find 3k+ ish square feet to accommodate working from home and in-law living.

Carmel was suggested| but after reading a million  threads here| I worry it’d crush my kids| sounds a little showy and overly-competitive| maybe? My kids are chill| bright| mildly athletic| kind| and world-travelled| but they’re not fierce social navigators.

Brownsburg| Whites-something| and Plainfield all look solid academically| but the available houses seem to tend toward the raw and new; I like slightly older areas with larger trees. Zionsville is a maybe| but it’s so expensive! Fishers and Noble-something are getting a bit far on commute.

Speedway high school has exceptional ratings| but does anything ever actually go up for sale there? It looks so conveniently located to the city and airport—I’m surprised there isn’t a lot of custom home stuff there? Is there some secret neighborhood it’s pulling from? Why doesn’t anyone recommend it to us| is there some terrible secret? (It’s a mystery. My curiosity runs rampant…)

I like the look of neighborhoods within the city itself—but rough school performance. Does everyone just do private high school within the loop? I’m assuming I’m too late for lotteries and such for the 2024-2025 school year.

I’ve heard great things about friendly Indiana. We leave next week for a weekend trip to see the area. Is there a neighborhood I’m overlooking? Things I care about: a non-pretentious high school with families committed to strong academics| a spacious house with some trees and character| fast internet.  Things I don’t care about: address status| hipster nightlife| churches| children’s amenities such as zoos or splash pads. Things I like but aren’t a deal-breaker: educated and open-minded neighbors| good restaurants.

Fire Pit - Fire rules,"I live in SE Indy and was looking to build a small fire pit in my backyard for campfire/social activities.

I found the open burning rules at https://www.indy.gov/activity/open-burning and it gives contradictory rules| I think?

""Marion County residents are allowed to burn only dried twigs or limbs and branches that originate from their property for disposal purposes""

Later on though under 'Open burning types allowed':

    * Cooking fires such as barbecue grills
    * Campfires| patio fire pits| or chimenea
    * Ceremonial bonfires conducted by established groups such as schools| churches| or other recognized organizations
    * Personal comfort fires

Each of those four types aren't for disposal purposes only. And within the rules ""Burn only between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 p.m."" - is that right? No camp fires in the evening/night?

Ritz Charles exclusive wedding venues - will it cost an arm and a leg?,"Hi| my (27F) fiance (31M) and I are getting married October 2025 with a total $20k budget. We are very fortunate to be receiving help from both our parents| are crafty with DIY projects| and prefer minimalist decor anyway. But at the same time| we're not trying to put too much on our plate over the next year and a half.

We want to throw a non-traditional| laid-back wedding with about 100 guests| and we're looking in Indy because we live here and my fiance grew up here| as well as the northern Indiana/SW Michigan area because that's where I grew up. We've only toured one venue in Harbor Country| MI| and it definitely set the bar. It was a craftsman-style| historic inn that used to be an artist residency. The ceremony space is a wooded backyard with a lovely pond| and the reception space is a cozy ballroom with tons of dark wood and a fireplace - but not rustic. We're looking at venues that have a similar vibe: outdoorsy| but not rustic| historic charm that wouldn't clash with more modern design| cozy kind of feeling.

The venues that check those boxes here in Indy all seem to be Ritz Charles venues; specifically The Bluffs at Conner Prairie| the Central Library| and Artisan Acres. Aesthetically| Artisan Acres is as dreamy as it gets| but I was able to find average pricing| including the venue and everything that would be provided by Ritz Charles. I like the idea of an all-inclusive vendor| but the price was pretty much our entire budget at an estimated $175-$200 a head. We wouldn't have enough for a photographer (the one vendor I am so willing to splurge on)| music| or decor - even if DIY'd. So that crossed Artisan Acres off the list.

I'm wondering| for those who have experience with these venues| if that's the standard for every Ritz Charles venue| or if Artisan Acres just happens to be one of the most expensive ones? Should I bother looking into these places with the budget we've set?",https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1cj9s91/ritz_charles_exclusive_wedding_venues_will_it/,0

Called the police and the cops got to my address within about 15 mins. We weren’t expecting any packages nor was our neighbor. Police identified the car as a lengthy enterprise rental. They said that what had likely happened was a drug drop. Our neighbor is selling his side of the duplex and those fuckers probably thought the entire property wasn’t occupied.

Dog Trainer specializing in Leash Reactivity in Indianapolis,I have never made a post like this before but I am at my wits end and need help finding a legitimate dog trainer specializing in leash reactivity. My dog Maya is around 5 years old and I got her when she was around 1. She was previously a stray and I don’t know much about her life before I got her. She’s overall a really sweet girl and has no issues off leash with cats and dogs of different sizes and breeds but when she’s on the leash she is very reactive. She will bark and lunge at dogs across the street and really anywhere in her vicinity. I previously did a 2 week Board and Train program with The Dog Wizard about a year ago and they gave me a prong collar to help with her pulling issues but it hasn’t helped with the leash reactivity at all. I try positive reinforcement methods on my own but once she spots another dog I am having a hard time getting her to focus on me. I am really seeking any recommendations of dog trainers in downtown Indianapolis that know how to handle leash reactive dogs and can help me to understand why she’s so reactive and also to help me train her. My boyfriend has even said he doesn’t think she will ever get better but I can’t accept that so if anyone can give me recommendations of trainers I would really appreciate it!,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/1cbx7wh/dog_trainer_specializing_in_leash_reactivity_in/,0

Things to Do in NYC: June 2024 Edition,"Every month I assemble the “[Blankman List](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/p/things-to-do-in-nyc-june-2024)|” which includes a wide range of events happening in New York City for every day of the month. In the free highlights below| I focus in on one part of June in NYC: Pride—a month for honoring people who are LGBTQIA+. After all| it’s local history; pride month commemorates the[ 1969 Stonewall Uprising in NYC](https://www.loc.gov/lgbt-pride-month/about/).

The citywide culmination of Pride is the [June 30 march down 5th Avenue](https://www.nycpride.org/event/nyc-pride-march)| but you have my full sympathy if cramming your way into the sidelines of a packed Manhattan parade isn’t your thing. (Though the events below includes a few similar options if it is!)

Pride is bigger than a parade. It is a chance to recognize and honor that people are not all cut from the same cloth. So for one month| I offer a variety of events to honor people along all the colors of the rainbow. Here is [May’s free events](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1bxduxk/things_to_do_in_nyc_may_2024_edition/) for the remainder of the month.

*Disclaimer: Before going anywhere| please confirm the date| time| location| cost| and description using the listed website.

I try to vet quality and describe accurately| but I may misjudge. All views are my own.*

# Dance and Celebrate

NYC is a premiere world destination to glitter and be gay. With its star-studded| blocks-wide festivities| a lot of the celebration around pride involves parades| parties| and dancing.

Walking into New York City Today (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all|

I am currently on day 413 of walking across America with my stroller “Smiley'' after having started up from La Push| WA and now having walked through WA| OR| ID| UT| CO| KS| MO| IL| KY| TN| SC| NC| VA| DC| MD| PA| and am now in Hoboken| NJ.

Today I’ll be crossing over into Manhattan and into New York City via the George Washington Bridge. After having walked from the Pacific Ocean| NYC will be where I reach the Atlantic| so I’m very HYPED and EXCITED. I technically got Into NYC and New York State via Staten Island yesterday| but I went right back into New Jersey| so today feels like more of the official entrance. If you see me on the way there or around town feel free to say hi.

I’ll be staying up in the upper west side tonight| but I’ll walk on down to Brooklyn and stay there for a few days.

Like I said before| New York City is actually where I’ll be seeing the Atlantic after having walked all the way from the Pacific. The celebration is planned for 4pm Saturday April 27th at Coney Island beach. It is an open invitation if anyone would like to come| the more the merrier.

After the celebration| I’m planning to walk from Brooklyn to Rockaway Beach on Monday. Then Tuesday I’ll walk back up to the Upper West Side to stay the night and then proceed Wednesday up to New Haven| CT for the final stop of the walk.

After New Haven| I’ll head back down to the city to spend a couple of weeks| so always open for recommendations on things to do and see while in town.

A big part of the reason I am doing the walk is to raise money for AmericaWalks| which is a national pedestrian advocacy and walkability organization. The most dangerous thing I deal with while walking is cars and in that way the advocacy is built into the activity. So if anyone is interested in making America a more walkable place and more pleasant for those outside of cars| I’d highly recommend checking them out at AmericaWalks.org and consider supporting their mission.

I’ve tried to meet with local advocacy groups that focus on walkability| bikeablity| urbanism along the way| so if anyone could help me get connected with them| I’d love the help. (I’m sure there are plenty across NYC)

Other than that| I am excited to get to New York City. If anyone would like to follow along or learn more| the best place to do that is walk2washington.com or on IG| FB at walkfromwashington (changed the name recently and didn’t want to pay for a new domain name lol).

Thanks|

Things to Do in NYC: May 2024 Edition,"When making these lists each month| I don’t really make a tourist vs. resident divide. The reality is that activities don’t fall neatly into one bucket or the other. Many tourists—anywhere| for that matter—want to do “non-touristy” things that provide a more authentic taste of the city they’re visiting. Residents do “touristy” things| too. New York City has some of the outright best theater in the world| for example. It attracts thousands of tourists *and residents* every week| but sometimes it feels like walking through at least six circles of hell to get there.

Every month I assemble the “[Blankman List](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/)|” a curated list of things to do around the city| with at least one event per day. In the [May 2024 Blankman List](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/p/things-to-do-in-nyc-may-2024)| I pay no mind to how mainstream or underground an event is and include some major bangers like [Mary J. Blige](https://www.barclayscenter.com/events/detail/strength-of-a-woman-festival-summit-2024)| [Kamasi Washington](https://www.msg.com/calendar/beacon-theatre-may-2024-kamasi-washington/3B00605C81DE0C7B)| and [Belle & Sebastian](https://www.brooklynparamount.com/shows). For the free highlights below| however| there is nary a mega-arena to be found. I zero in on the understated| the esoteric| and the events most unlike typical NYC tourist fare.

Here are [April’s free highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1b9pzf2/things_to_do_in_nyc_april_2024_edition/) for the remainder of the month.

## Contemporary and Experimental Art

I am an eternal advocate for the *living* arts. Painting did not end with Monet. Opera did not end with Verdi. If you’ve never seen an experimental work before| your first instinct might be to cringe or to laugh| and to that I say: *that’s okay*. Screw the gatekeepers who act like they’ve never raised an eyebrow at something really weird. Stay through the end| and you just might walk away with a broader conception of what is possible through art.

* Tuesday| May 7: [Charlotte Mundy: Strange Moving Power](https://www.as-coa.org/events/charlotte-mundy-strange-moving-power)

## Off- and Off-Off-Broadway Theater

Among the hundreds of venues across New York City that aren’t considered Broadway| there is a stunning range of theater happening on any given day: one-person shows| experimental plays| classic revivals| ancient stories| non-English theater| and so on. To the tourist who’s just here for a weekend| my recommendation is typically just to stick to [Broadway](https://bwayrush.com/). But to anyone who has the time or inclination| this city offers much| much more than *The Lion King* and *Wicked*!

* Saturday| May 4–Sunday| May 19: [Roald Dahl’s Matilda The Musical](https://www.galleryplayers.com/)

   * La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club| The Downstairs
   * 66 E 4th St| basement level (Bowery| Manhattan)

## Art House and Indie Film Screenings

I sing a lot of praises about this city| though there’s no question that cinephiles will find their homecoming in Los Angeles| not New York City. That said| NYC is still a major film hub| with endless opportunities to see films that are indie| foreign| short| experimental| or otherwise tough to find elsewhere at a public screening.

* Thursday| May 2—Thursday| May 9: [Wildcat](https://www.angelikafilmcenter.com/nyc/movies/details/wildcat)
   * 2023 biopic about novelist Flannery O’Connor directed by Ethan Hawke; 7 pm

## Events Outside Manhattan and Brooklyn

New York City comprises five boroughs| each of which used to be its own city. Manhattan is the behemoth| with hundreds of imposing skyscrapers. Brooklyn is still an outer borough| to be sure; however| it is the most populous one and is heavily represented throughout my [monthly list](https://blankmanlist.substack.com/). Yet that still leaves out three boroughs and millions of residents! Everyone in NYC is just just a subway (and in the case of Staten Island| ferry) ride away from thousands of restaurants| event venues| and art spaces with hardly a tourist in sight.

* Friday| May 3: [Free First Friday at the Noguchi Museum](https://www.noguchi.org/museum/calendar/event/2024-05-03-1100-free-first-friday/)

   * Claret Wine Bar
   * 4602 Skillman Ave (Sunnyside| Queens)

## University Events Open to the Public

Between the CUNY system| the SUNY system| graduate schools| and private institutions| New York City is home to over 100 colleges and universities. Many of them host art and cultural exhibitions| along with music| dance| theater| and lectures that are cheap or free and open to the public. I particularly recommend checking out performances from some of the city’s world class conservatories| such as Juilliard and the Manhattan School of Music.

A few more random things to do/see in Houston,"Houston| you’ve surprised me yet again. (I moved from CA| then lived in TX on & off for about 6-7 years & now live in a completely different state from the two). I try to visit my family every 1-2 months| but of course they work Mon-Fri & although I’m gracing them with my presence they still must work; I periodically go gallivanting solo as often as the mosquitoes let me roam.

I’ve never been to this part of town| although I’ve been a block over to see a show at the theatre & I used to work at Live! At Bayou! up until it closed.  But today was the first time I’ve walked through/seen the Heritage Society area| the park here & thanks to Reddit comments| the beautiful original library which is now known as the Julia Ideson Building. Theres a gorgeous reading room (perfect if you’re still studying!) & a random brick archive across from it.

Whether you’re visiting & looking for something to do or relax in/at| or you line here & didn’t know it existed… hopefully you get to check out any of the above anytime soon!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cr5x8h,0

Looking for a few recommendations; antique shops| boutiques| record stores| markets/pop ups| etc,"I'm in Houston for the weekend with my wife and we are trying to figure out a few more things to do later today and tomorrow| we are staying in Montrose so nearby places would be preferred| but we are open to driving a bit.

What we are most after are antique/vintage shops| we enjoy finding nice little knickknacks for the house| vintage clothing| and furniture (we got the SUV with us thankfully).

As far as record stores| I love Houston Rap (Z Ro| DJ Screw| Scarface| UGK| the whole SUC| etc) and old school latino music (boleros| corridos| cumbia) so any shops that specialize in these genders would be great| but if not| anything with a good hip hop| indie/alt rock| and jazz collection would be nice.

As far as markets or pop ups| we're really just trying to get a taste of local restaurants/food vendors| artists| local businesses| etc. Ideally something with a mix of different cultures; Latinos| Blacks| Asians| even white people have their cool shit (please don’t take this seriously lol)

Walking into New York City Today (Walking Across America),"Howdy Y’all|

I am currently on day 413 of walking across America with my stroller “Smiley'' after having started up from La Push| WA and now having walked through WA| OR| ID| UT| CO| KS| MO| IL| KY| TN| SC| NC| VA| DC| MD| PA| and am now in Hoboken| NJ.

Today I’ll be crossing over into Manhattan and into New York City via the George Washington Bridge. After having walked from the Pacific Ocean| NYC will be where I reach the Atlantic| so I’m very HYPED and EXCITED. I technically got Into NYC and New York State via Staten Island yesterday| but I went right back into New Jersey| so today feels like more of the official entrance. If you see me on the way there or around town feel free to say hi.

I’ll be staying up in the upper west side tonight| but I’ll walk on down to Brooklyn and stay there for a few days.

Like I said before| New York City is actually where I’ll be seeing the Atlantic after having walked all the way from the Pacific. The celebration is planned for 4pm Saturday April 27th at Coney Island beach. It is an open invitation if anyone would like to come| the more the merrier.

After the celebration| I’m planning to walk from Brooklyn to Rockaway Beach on Monday. Then Tuesday I’ll walk back up to the Upper West Side to stay the night and then proceed Wednesday up to New Haven| CT for the final stop of the walk.

After New Haven| I’ll head back down to the city to spend a couple of weeks| so always open for recommendations on things to do and see while in town.

A big part of the reason I am doing the walk is to raise money for AmericaWalks| which is a national pedestrian advocacy and walkability organization. The most dangerous thing I deal with while walking is cars and in that way the advocacy is built into the activity. So if anyone is interested in making America a more walkable place and more pleasant for those outside of cars| I’d highly recommend checking them out at AmericaWalks.org and consider supporting their mission.

I’ve tried to meet with local advocacy groups that focus on walkability| bikeablity| urbanism along the way| so if anyone could help me get connected with them| I’d love the help. (I’m sure there are plenty across NYC)

Other than that| I am excited to get to New York City. If anyone would like to follow along or learn more| the best place to do that is walk2washington.com or on IG| FB at walkfromwashington (changed the name recently and didn’t want to pay for a new domain name lol).

Thanks|

Klein ISD Sports Fundraising ,So we are relatively new to the area coming from the east coast. Our son is playing on one of the ISD football teams. The athletics departments at the schools here when it comes to funding are the equivalent to the Taj Mahal compared to schools in the southeast.  What I don’t understand is based on the high taxes that we pay here how is that the school has a mandatory fundraiser where my kid is required to give 20 plus names and email addresses to a soliciting group that will harass family and friends non stop to get $500 per kid out of them?  Where does the tax money go besides these insane football stadiums around here? The coach pulled 23 kids in the gym today and tells them that they are leaders and they are setting a bad example by not raising money and helping towards uniforms and helmets. You guys haven’t done jack to help. I’m sorry not every person has a large group of family and friends that has spare money laying around to give away and receive nothing in return.

Houston Astros around same time want new ballpark or will go to Washington DC. Voters passed their stadium bill on first try.

Houston Oilers demand new stadium and basically told no. It wasn’t even up to vote.

It was at this moment though that he said I couldn’t enter because of my shoes(I was wearing Jordan’s). I asked him if he was serious| and he than proceeded to say in a sarcastic voice “no it’s because you’re black”.

I just proceed to walk away because I was with my finance and I’m not the type of person to make a scene. However the more I’ve thought about this the more it’s really pissed me off.

valet parking is out of control,The valets at MOST houston restaurants are driving me insane.

It’s basically a cover to walk into half the restaurants in houston and it’s driving me insane. Sports Bars will have valets even though they have an expansive parking lot right in front of them. I honestly don’t go to some restaurants I love because they have unnecessary valets that you can’t avoid. I once went around a valet at a casual restaurant and self parked and they chased me down to ask me for my keys after I parked myself then asked me for a tip…. I’m going insane.

In Houston| it seems like either you find a free gym that's filled with middle and high schoolers on summer vacation| or you have to pay $100+ a month for a nicer gym membership like Lifetime.

I don't mind paying| but looking for a more affordable option at least. Ideally| I'd be playing once a week. if anyone has any spots| I would very much appreciate it.

Would there be any interest in a semi-regular meet-up designed to help people make new friends?,"I work in a Houston area public library and I've been toying lately with an idea for a new adult program that would be somewhat similar to speed dating but for adults in the community to find new friends. It seems to me that once people leave a school setting it can be very difficult to meet new people (outside of the internet) who share similar interests with you and befriend them. I can even recall seeing reddit posts of people asking others how to make friends once they leave school.

So I was curious to know if any of you would like there to be a semi-regular event that would allow you to fill out a basic ""likes and hobbies"" sheet and then to meet either one on or in small groups based on shared interests to talk a bit and see if you vibe with anyone? Then| if you find anyone you think you might like to hang with| you can exchange online contact info with one another.

We get players aged 21-42 to join and you can sign up by yourself or with friends and are then guaranteed to get placed on a coed team. Or sign up your own full team. Our Summer leagues are now registering and we've got lots of 16"" Softball| Kickball| Beach Volleyball and Family Feud Trivia.

Some teams are really good| others not so much and they still enjoy playing and having drinks with the whole league at our league sponsor bar a short walk from games. There are lots of options for leagues in Chicago| but if you're looking for a coed| recreational level league with all skills levels welcome| we'd love to have you! You'll for sure make new friends and have a really unique| customized and personal league experience.

Check out my upcoming leagues at [s3leagues.com](http://s3leagues.com)| and use promo code 'GetSocial' for $20 off most leagues too!

Why doesn't the NCRR have more upscale service like Brightline on Piedmont trains?,"EDITED TO SUMMARIZE:

The Piedmont trains (Charlotte to Raleigh) are all-coach.

Why doesn't the NC Department of Transportation add a premium section to those trains' coaches (e.g.| a section with bigger seats and perhaps drinks and snacks)| a premium lounge at the Charlotte station| and shuttles to the Charlotte| Greensboro and Raleigh airports| and charge a premium for the portion of riders who would prefer that?

Brightline has all of that| and even Amtrak offers first-class service on some trains.  By doing that| the Piedmont trains could get more riders and if premium services were priced to make a profit| subsidies overall would be reduced

This is NOT a request for additional trains| new equipment| faster trains| etc.  It's simply a suggestion to do as other railroads do and offer a first-class section on existing trains| plus shuttles and a few other amenities| which riders who prefer that would pay for.

# # # #

ORIGINAL POST:

I took Brightline| the Miami-Orlando fast train. It's great; it's like the Acela Express| but the stations are sleeker and the staff is really nice.  It's also very customer-friendly; for example| some stations have Brightline-run shuttles that pair with trains and take you to the airport or destinations within a range of a few miles from the station.

Question: Why doesn't the NCRR offer a more premium-priced service as part of its Charlotte-Raleigh Piedmont trains| with similar amenities?

I am not looking for tax subsidies for upscale passengers; conversely| offering a Brightline-type service| in addition to what the Piedmont trains currently have| could be profitable and reduce the need for subsidies.

For example:

\* A premium class of service onboard| at prices high enough that it would be profitable (and thus help cover the costs of economy-class service).

\* Shuttles from train stations to airports| sports arenas| etc.  (Brightline's shuttle to the Miami airport| for example| is $10| and it should cover costs and attract some riders.)

By not doing this| isn't the NCRR missing out on higher revenues and some passengers?  For example| Brightline is sleek enough that any managing director at Bank of America would feel right at home; conversely| coach on the Piedmont might not appeal to someone like that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1d0jvx8/why_doesnt_the_ncrr_have_more_upscale_service/,0

My daughter started doing gymnastics and when they offered a summer camp registration in the winter| we immediately jumped on it. Well| when we woke up this morning| we read the email that it has been cancelled.

If anyone knows of anything| please drop it here. Amount of days or hours per day doesn't matter. It beats day care costs.

Edit: We are in Lawrenceville (we LOVE it here btw). We'll commute about 30 min depending on the times of camp.

Don Farr moving ,"Hi all| just wanted to let you all know to never use Don Farr for moving. I did for a move recently & not only did they do a horrendously bad job (for real| they had to send out 2 more guys to clean up the incredible mess the first crew left)| they STOLE both my wallet & a fireproof envelope in which I keep all my irreplaceable documents.  This includes my Certificate of Naturalization| issued by Homeland Security| & is my only proof that I am a US citizen| as well as 2 passports (I have dual citizenship).

So if you'd prefer not having criminals sent to your home to paw through your belongings & steal what they like| I'd highly recommend avoiding Don Farr| who have been an utter nightmare to deal with on every conceivable level.

An Idea for a Bar in the City,"I have a dream/idea for a bar in KC that I think would be incredibly popular. Before I give the deets| I’ll share that I have talked to quite a few my age range about it and haven’t heard anything negative about the idea.

First off| in KC proper| there are a ton of cool bars but on a Friday/Saturday night| they’re taken over by the college age crowd and slightly older. They’re fine| but not the age group most over the age of 30 want to be around. We don’t want to be shoulder to shoulder in a packed bar getting run into by “Chads and Tylers” and having drinks spilled on us. We don’t want to wait in lines to get a drink behind 2 guys buying the shittiest of shots for a group of girls and tipping 1%. We don’t want to deal with fights and the violence that happens around these places.

Now| we still want a vibrant social single scene in the city| where we can have conversation. Be able to see who we’re talking to| enjoy music we like without having to yell into each others ears. Have someone actually bring us a drink when ours is getting low and be able to get something to eat without wondering about the health violations in the kitchen. We don’t want to worry about fights and then violence spilling out around us.

We don’t want it to be a dive bar where depression walks through the door constantly| and we don’t want it to be super upscale where 4 drinks and a couple apps is gonna run you $200-$300 just because you’re not on a ground floor. We also don’t want another craft beer brewery or sports bar. Those places aren’t where you go to be single and social. Also| we don’t want a club playing loud ass music we don’t know or doesn’t have words.

So here’s my full idea for the bar:
1. Reasonably well lit. Not lights fully turned on| but we aren’t running a club where you just feel around for ass to be able to navigate.
2. We only let in as many people as we have seats for. People don’t have to be seated at tables| we’re not running it like a restaurant| but everyone has a seat if they want it.
3. We play only popular music from the 80s| 90s| and 00s. Any song(and it can be any genre) played in our bar is required to be at least 21 years old. We will not specialize in any genre. It’s not a country bar| hip hop| rock| or pop only. You may get Dre and Snoop followed by Garth Brooks| followed by Backstreet Boys. Music will be loud enough and originate from an area of the bar where you can dance to it| but it won’t be played at a level where you can’t get away from it and have a conversation.
4. We have cheap beer| a few craft beers| and some upscale cocktails along with a full bar. You want an espresso martini and a pitcher of Coors Light? We got you covered.
5. We will have a food menu where you can orders apps or a full meal. Think similar to a Granfalloon.
6. A couple TVs will be up at the bar area for those who might want to watch the game| but we’re not a sports bar who’s gonna have TVs on the game everywhere. Any TVs around the bar will be tuned to ambiance after 8pm. Of course we will have Chiefs games on when they’re playing.
7. We will have a nice deck area. We want the vibe there to be the backyard party with friends after everyone ate and is now a little tipsy. Comfy deck chairs| low tables| set up in a way to facilitate coversation.
8. THIS is the big one. How we will keep the vibes we’re going for and why the bar would be financially a success long term. YOU HAVE TO BE AT LEAST 31 YEARS OLD TO ENTER. No exceptions. It’s your boyfriend’s 31st bday and you’re 30? Sorry| see you next year. He can come in| you can’t. Guess what? You also get one more milestone that you get to look forward to. 31st bdays will be celebrated in our bar! Sticking to the age requirement not only gives us a place that won’t be taken over by the college crowd| it also increases the safety level. Staffing it would be easier as the clientele has a higher income level and tends to tip substantially better. They will also deal with less drunken entitlement throughout the night.
9. Lastly| I have the perfect spot for it. The old Ale House in Westport. It would be our oasis in the sea of stupidity that is Westport at night. For those who grew up going out in Westport| you could come back and be in a safe place with fun vibes again. The city is sorely lacking this option and single population that would prefer not to live/drive to JoCo for a night out would have somewhere to go where we could easily Uber in and Uber out. We will set up valet service in the spots on Broadway in front of the bar after 8pm. Not only will this give people a way to park easily| it will also prevent people from pulling up and hanging out by their cars blasting music and causing problems. We will move that further away making it safer.

I am personally not someone who has ever ran a bar. I’m putting this idea out there to people who have/do or might be able to take the idea and run with it. It would draw a crowd. There is a population of people in their 30s| 40s| 50s| etc that wants to still go out but don’t have that comfortable and vibrant party we crave. Anyway| let me know what you think!

Warrensburg or Lee’s Summit,"My girlfriend recently found out she was to be stationed at Whiteman AFB. We are excited for the move but wanted to figure out if a longer commute might be worth it to live in Lee’s Summit. I have heard positive things about the downtown area and proximity to KC. From Warrensburg the commute would be 20 minutes but from Lee’s Summit it would be 50. We are both in our late 20s and we like live music and would be looking to make friends.

Kansas/Missouri culture ,"Wondering the sort of culture in Kansas/Missouri...I am from the mid-atlantic/east coast| and I know we have a reputation for seeming cold and unfriendly. What I have come to realize is that we just keep our heads down and maybe we don't say hello to random folks on the street| but we will help people out and support our communities and we are kind people. We also don't tend to do the fake polite thing. Like| I'm not going to ask you to hang out or do something if I have no intention.

I've heard of ""Midwestern nice"" and I admit I'm a bit hesitant.  I am looking to move to Kansas City and i would like to make friends| but is the ""Midwestern nice"" something I need to take into consideration? I sort of fear really being authentic but then people just being polite to my face but nothing else| because that makes me introvert myself| which I don't want to do.

Do the Royals really care about local fans?,"I just read the article in the Star about the contract dispute between Comcast and the Diamond Sports Group.  Yet another media outlet that no longer carries the Royals nor can you find them on network TV.  It just seems like the Royals are becoming more and more inaccessible to the local fan. If you do not have a cable provider and you do not subscribe to FUBO| DirecTV| Bally Sports +| etc.| you don’t get to see the local team play.  It seems like such a money grab by a team that until recently has not been great.  I would like to see John Sherman follow in the footsteps of Ryan Smith| owner of the Utah Jazz who puts all of the games on a local TV station in Utah or Matt Ishiba| owner of the Phoenix Suns who also puts all of the games on local TV and if you don’t have an antenna| he will provide you one free of charge.

It seems like the Royals are extremely short sighted and are not building their fan base for the future.  They wonder why the new stadium was voted down and everybody has the basic feeling of “meh” when the Royals threatened to leave town.  Don’t get me wrong| I was a life long Royals fan but have to followed them since I cut the cord and don’t want to pay Bally Sports to see my local team play.

What bar did my uncle take me to in 1992?,"The answer to this question probably isn’t knowable| but I’d love to hear some speculation. My favorite uncle| who had a weird side job being a secret shopper for Taco Bell in the early ‘90s| took me and my brother with him one afternoon when I was 11 or 12. Eating at four or five Taco Bells in a row was obviously of great interest to me at that age. He also took us to his regular bar| the first I’d ever been to. I’ve often wondered which it was. He doesn’t remember. We weren’t from Cincinnati and I was 12 years old| so I don’t know the area well| but here’s what I recall:

He was a mainstay of the local hardcore scene| having fronted an agit-prop punk group that was part of the Jockey Club scene| and also an educator and union guy| so those were his people. Or at least he was tolerated by them. He was definitely a regular because he introduced us to the bartender.

The bar was probably on the east side of town. He lived in Mt. Washington but it was in the city.

It was on a commercial street alongside other 19th C. buildings — not in a strip mall or detached building. It was street parking.
It had a shuffleboard court inside.

Everyone seems old when you’re 12 but it definitely felt like an old man bar. The clientele seemed 40+. He was in his late thirties at the time.

I think there was a front and back. Front bar was high tops and lots of neon.

That’s all I remember. Realizing this could be like 50 different places| any guesses?

Sound engineer for echoey house?,Can anyone recommend a sound engineer in the area who will come into your house and analyze the acoustics and help you figure out how to dampen the interior noise?

Beware. Local company recording interactions in home ,"As an employee it feels wrong but as a human it feels even more wrong| so I have to let this info out.

This is a throw away account for obvious reasons.

Ohio law states that if a conversation is being recorded and 1 party is aware of it then it’s totally legal. It’s called a 1 party state.

Apollo home has a new software that they’ve been using for the last few months called Rilla. Rilla is designed to listen in and critique your customer interactions with every customer. It will even tell you if you’re using the wrong inflections to close a sale. Every time you have an Apollo home employee in your home be fully aware that the conversation between you and them in your home is being recorded. They are all reviewed by management and the Rilla team. This is not something they tell you about or disclose because based on Ohio law this is not illegal.

I feel wrong using this and people not knowing but we’re told not to tell the customer that it is even a thing. So consider this a buyer beware for your future interactions with us as a hvac| plumbing or electrical provider.

Who can I yell at?,"First world problem incoming...

I have altafiber internet.  It's great.  I also pay like $75 for YoutubeTV| and I thought I might save a few bucks switching to the Altafiber internet/cable bundle.  They have one advertised for about $90| which sounded pretty good.

As I'm talking to the agent| she says my monthly bill will be more like $150.  Hold up!  Turns out aside from equipment rental| there's almost $50 in ""fees and taxes.""

It's not the agent's fault.  She didn't make the policy. But I want to be able to call or email Altafiber and voice my displeasure| and there doesn't seem to be a listed method of doing that| short of hassling a CSR who can't control it either.

Dog groomer in the area that deals with skunk smell removal? ,Hello guys| moved here 2-3 months ago and haven’t had my dog (golden retriever) groomed in this area yet. 10ish days ago he was sprayed in the face by a skunk.

So I'm Designing a Game That Takes Place in a Fictional Cincinnati...,"The game is titled| ""Dunderbeck"" and it takes place in a version of Cincinnati where mythical creatures are commonplace - you play as an exterminator turned sausage-crafter.

I was wondering| dear Cincinnatians| what iconic aspects or in-jokes from your city should make it into the game?

I have to turn in| but thank you for all of your ideas and feedback - I'm super glad I chose Cincinnati :D There is so much stuff (I was expecting only a couple replies| but this has been wild!) - I am going to mull over all of this and see what all I can implement.

I’m often accosted four times or more while out on my walks| even WITH my dog in tow.

Two different men have tried to follow me home after dark  in the last TWO DAYS.

I’ve noticed a trend in behavior like this increasing when it’s warm out (I wonder why) which is disgusting| but it seems especially bad this year. Idk what is going on.

Well| he spent the last week going into shops and aggressively harassing workers and patrons. The police were called multiple times by both workers and shoppers who felt unsafe.

Today he was arrested| his mugshot can be found online as well as his record of previous Hamilton County arrests.

I do understand that issues surrounding addiction| homelessness| panhandling and mental illness are very polarizing. Unfortunately not all of these folks are safe to be around.

Recommendations for Junk Removal (or Dumpster Rental),"Located on the West Side - in between Covedale/Price Hill/Green Township

TL;DR : junk removal OR dumpster rental recommendations for a few large items

I have an old reclining loveseat and a mattress I need gone for sure - possibly some big tree branches and other junk also.

I called a junk removal place (family friend’s business)| and it was $350 to just haul away a loveseat and mattress 🙃 is this a normal price? Seems expensive!

I also emailed rumpke about large item pickup and they had very specific instructions - seems like a lot of work on our end for them to pickup| and they can’t do it in one pickup either. $30 per large pick up request| but if I’m reading the email right| I would have to take apart the loveseat into four pieces| and wrap all of them in plastic| as well as fold and wrap the mattress... then they do 5 pickups? (Could be interpreting the email wrong). My sister and I can hardly lift the loveseat| so we would struggle trying to take it apart.

I’m open to the idea of a dumpster rental - if we’re going to be spending $$$| does it make sense to get a dumpster rental and just go nuts throwing stuff away? Could also ask our neighbor if they had stuff to get rid of (I’m confident they have some stuff) and then we could split the cost to make it cheaper for us both.

"CPD Chief on Withrow HS shooting: ""There's nothing we could have done...we can't stop every party"".","That quote is from Chief Theetge at the gun violence press conference earlier this AM.  For context| CPD was called for a noise complaint at Withrow HS and they found a party ""behind the school"".  They found ""no violations"" and left.  Not long after| 30-40 shots were fired and an 18 year old died.

On one hand| I get it...kids want to get together and celebrate...But on the other hand| we've seen time and time again in Cincinnati that groups of kids| left unsupervised in the early hours of the morning  will end up in fights or shootings...and in this case| homicide.  Also| the kids were partying at the school| which should(?) legally be off limits after dark.  CPD turning a blind eye to 30+ kids at 1-2AM just shows they lack any will to intervene in a meaningful way.  Theetge is just passing the buck.

Is anyone else bothered by her comments? When will she and Pureval actually do something?

Apartment building for actual adults downtown ?,"I find myself nearing 40 while living in a building that’s on the corner of fourth and a street-named-after-a-purple-shaded fruit.

While during the winter and fall it’s quiet| spring and summer bring a bunch of visitors to tenants that cause problems - ie they bring dogs they don’t clean up after| broken glass on the pool area and within the shared spaces of the property| etc. Management has been stretched thin since the day I moved in years ago| even after changing staff a few times; it’s always been this way and forever will be. I wasn’t even near the age of the average tenant when I first moved in; it was winter and I saw nobody but the leasing agent.

*shrugs*

Yes I knew what I was getting into living downtown.
Yes I know that density creates opportunity for these situations.
Yes I know living downtown is much different than say| West Chester.
This is specific to my building and the average age of folks living here.

Beyond moving into an old folks home| are there any buildings/complexes that aren’t chock full of 21 to 25 year olds downtown? At 21-25 there’s no way I could have afforded to live here| so the level of responsibility with the crowds is low since it’s not on them as tenants to give a shit. “The lease is under Daddy’s name; he will handle it.”

I work here| invest here| am part of the residents council and don’t want to have to move out of the CBD. My building is a notorious party spot (didn’t know when I signed the initial lease years ago)| and it’s not going to change until they literally set the roof on fire. Some tenants are older than me and have been here longer| they just tolerate things differently. To each their own.

So I pose the question: where are all the downtowners that don’t want to buy a condo and still rent because they love the city and want to stay in the downtown/CBD area?

Let the shit-talking and downvotes begin…
But any suggestions are appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1cw31x6/apartment_building_for_actual_adults_downtown/,0

Ode to the Mill Creek ,I know most think gross sewage and foul smells when you hear anything about the Mill Creek.  When I was a child in the 90s the Creek was still very foul and stinked in the the summer.  I grew up around the Mill Creek and have watched it become beautiful again.  I live near it and walk around it often. There are so many beautiful plants and flowers now. An abundance of wildlife everywhere! I often see Bald Eagles|  Herons| Turtles|  huge fat happy fish| and in the winter it is filled with thousands of crows. I joined the Mill Creek Alliance on  canoe trip and saw the absolute wonders of the Creek many can't witnesses from land.  I've seen countless people fishing there and if you go through the gates of the Greenway trail near northside you can walk on the edges and see so many beautiful things. I'm hoping the Creek will get better and better as the years go on. I'm grateful to the people who watch over it and the changes in policies that have helped it be less polluted.

While there are plenty of different methods for rust removal on cast iron available online| and I did try a couple (spent a few hours this morning on it)| the job is just too big and want to take the easy route - putting them in an electrolysis tank.

"""The LDS Church’s historic temple-building spree is fracturing communities across the country"" A Cincinnati temple was announced in April.","[https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/05/17/its-created-lot-division-how-lds/](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/05/17/its-created-lot-division-how-lds/)

The article is paywalled but I've extracted parts here and linked additional detail.  You can find articles addressing specific facets of the issue all over the web| eg [Vegas](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13334769/mormon-temple-Lone-Mountain-Nevada-town-anger-height.html)| [Texas](https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/fairview-faces-legal-threat-as-p-z-votes-down-proposed-mormon-temple-design-theyre-being-a-bully/)| even [Utah](https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/county-officials-to-review-controversial-plan-to-build-lds-temple-in-rural-area).  The [Cincinnati site ](https://www.thechurchnews.com/temples/2024/04/29/temples-cincinnati-ohio-des-moines-iowa-site-locations-first-presidency-announced/)has been announced but that doesn't mean you have no say.  And if the community likes it| great!

""The church has recently entered a building spree| with more than 150 temples planned or under construction.""  [Here's the comprehensive list ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/temples/list?lang=eng)

Much like airports| the temples may be named after a city but they are often sited in a small| nearby town.  ""From Nevada to Wyoming to Texas| small towns have become neighborhood battlegrounds as feuds break out about the buildings’ height and light.""  The current designs are much more obtrusive than necessary| often damaging town character such as this [88|000 square foot building](https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/heber-valley-utah-temple/news/) on an 18 acre site in a town that was once celebrated for its dark sky initiatives and stunning mountain views| in contrast to the [Chicago Temple ](https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/chicago-illinois-temple/)(actually in a wealthy suburb 45 minutes north of the city) which| while still big| and still intruding upon a historic home| museum| and nature preserve| fits in a bit better with the local community aesthetic.

The article cites people who ""...are adamant: They have nothing against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or its members.  What the DeLoes do have a problem with is the church’s plans to build a[ 215-foot-high building with hundreds of parking spots](https://churchofjesuschristtemples.org/lone-mountain-nevada-temple/) in an area where residents sometimes ride horses in the street and the tallest things around are palm trees.""

""Due to their opposition| both say they’ve repeatedly been called bigots. Yard signs they plant opposing the temple disappear overnight and cars periodically sit at the end of their driveway| honking.""  “We have people setting off fireworks behind the homes of people who are coming out against \[the temple\].”

LDS Temples are not churches.  They are not open on Sunday.  They are considered holier than traditional meetinghouses and function as private clubs--visitors are \*not\* allowed.  They are used to baptize dead people and perform other Masonic| patriarchal ordinances for them [even if this is against family wishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_for_the_dead#Controversy) ; these same ordinances are done once for the living member themselves. In order to enter you must follow a set of rules that includes paying [10% of your income](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/26-temple-recommends?lang=eng) to the church's investment and operations portfolio (donations for charitable works are an additional| optional charge) and wearing [holy garments (""magic underwear"")](https://www.thechurchnews.com/leaders/2024/04/14/first-presidency-letter-garmet-of-the-holy-priesthood-temple-recommend-statement/)  Adherence to these rules is assessed in interviews with untrained| volunteer ""bishops"" who will also ask you about your sexuality and may ask invasive questions about your sexual practices.  Such questions [may be asked of children as young as 11 years old.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/24/us/mormon-young-excommunicated/index.html)

""The last thing this city needs is another lawsuit|” Commissioner Donald Walsh said before casting his vote in the temple’s favor.""  This politician's perspective is pragmatic.  If your town does not have airtight ordinances| [the LDS church will sue your community](https://www.wyomingnews.com/news/local_news/lds-church-sues-city-of-cody-over-planning-process/article_e939d660-275c-11ee-b954-7f32fc2003d8.html) at [every turn](https://www.kpcw.org/wasatch-county/2024-05-02/judge-allows-lds-church-to-join-heber-valley-temple-lawsuit).  Their access to [liquid assets ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/15/mormon-church-whistleblower-taxes-hedge-fund)and [land ](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12868689/mormon-church-owns-land-bill-gates-china.html)is unprecedented [for a religion in the US. ](https://widowsmitereport.wordpress.com/) 

If a building like the temples currently being built is not in harmony with the goals of your community| the time is now to ensure that local code prevents them.  

In order to function| LDS temples do not have to be huge| they do not have to have spires| they do not have to be brightly lit.  By banning buildings that are out of character with your community| you are not banning LDS church members| nor preventing their faithful practices| you are simply deciding for yourselves what your community should look like.

Not that it should need to be said| but this post is not about members.  Most LDS members themselves are nice people and usually make great neighbors.  They will nearly always help you move and are happy to bring cookies.  This is not an issue against LDS members| their faith| or practices.  It is an issue about the Corporation of the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints bullying communities to accommodate obtrusive buildings against resident's wills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1cuydrd/the_lds_churchs_historic_templebuilding_spree_is/,0

Office building conversions to residential ,"While the ongoing changes to the zoning codes will hopefully expand housing availability in the city| one trend I think could have an even bigger positive effect on the vibrancy of our downtown area is converting underutilized office buildings into residences| as this story describes.

I'd like to see City Council doing what they can to support these efforts (short of shoveling public funds into developers' private pockets).

Reflecting on Kraftwerk @ MegaCorp Pavilion - May 16,"Last night Kraftwerk played what I would think to be one of the most anticipated concerts of 2024 in Greater Cincinnati.

Let me state upfront that I had seen Kraftwerk in concert a couple of times before| but that was about 15 years ago. Since then| nothing really has changed. No new albums or new material. Same lineup with one original member still at it (Ralph Hutter).

Kraftwerk had never before played here| and the mere thought that not only they would be playing here| but doing so at an intimate venue like MegaCorp Pavilion (indoor capacity 2|700) made this a must-see event| period.

There was no opening act. Kraftwerk came on stage at about 8:25 pm| and dove straight into its traditional opener Numbers/Computer World/Computer World Part 2.

When playing Spacelab early in the show| the video paying on a massive screen behind the band showed a flying saucer hovering above the Greater Cincinnati skyline| and eventually landing at MegaCorp| to a massive reaction from the crowd.

Midway into their set| Kraftwerk played the entire ""Autobahn"" album front to back| in celebration of the album's 50th anniversary this year.

The sound mix was absolutely perfect| as were the visuals (a massive part of the Kraftwerk experience). What makes Kraftwerk so interesting is that| despite much of their material being 40+ years old| they nevertheless have retained their aura of being ""ahead of their time""| and last night proved that point once again.

They played a 2 hr. set and when the band's traditional closer (Boing Boom Tschak/Techno Pop/Musique Non Stop)| I couldn't believe it all had come and gone so fast.

I absolutely loved last night's show. I had taken my (grown-up) daughter along. She had never actively listened to any of Kraftwerk's music before. But she did recognize several of the songs| and more importantly| she seemed to enjoy the overall experience.

Here the setlist from last night:

Mold Found in A/C Provided by Landlord. How do I get them to replace it or disinfect it? What steps should I take if the issue is not take care of?,"I’ve been living in my rental for about 4 years. The property is provided with the following appliances: A/C window unit| stove| dishwasher| and fridge. These appliances are listed in my lease as provided by the landlord.

This year I performed a mold test on the A/C due to some concerns I had about the musty smell coming from the unit when I turned it on.
They came back positive for mold. I alerted my landlord about this on 4/27. Initially| they told me to clean the filter. I did that but I am unconvinced that the dirty filter was the source of the mold.

I told them I wanted the inside of the unit disinfected or the whole unit replaced. Landlord attempted to open unit initially but gave up after about 15 min saying they would research how to open it| citing a fear of breaking it. That was about 2 weeks ago. The days are getting warmer and I would like to be able to use my A/C unit in June. However| I fear that my landlord is dragging their feet on fixing this issue in the hopes that I will just give up and not ask them about it any more.

I read online that you can file a complaint with the city health department about mold in rental units and they will send someone out to verify the complaint. If the unsuitable living condition is verified| they can sent a written statement to the landlord about the issue to expedite the process and issue a citation to unresponsive landlords. I have also research rent escrow as a possible option if the issue is not fixed.

Does anyone have any more knowledge or experiences dealing with similar situations in Cincinnati? If so| what is the best course of action for me to take? I’m reading conflicting info on whether mold removal or removal of faulty provided appliances falls under landlord responsibilities or not. Would appreciate some guidance on how to proceed.

Help! Hot water heater is acting up (new home owner),"Yesterday| 5/13| our pilot light on our water heater went out. We tried to re-light it and it wasn’t working| so we called Apollo to come to our house and help fix it. They came out today and got it back up and running and charged us ~$170 for it (uhg). They told us that a bunch of stuff was illegal| not to code| etc| even though we had a good (to our knowledge) inspection done when we bought the house about 1.5 years ago. They then quoted us ~$5k for replacing the water heater| fixing the things that aren’t to code| and their annual warranty.

Buying a House in Bond Hill,"Good morning|

My wife and I are thinking of putting an offer in on a gorgeous house in Bond Hill around the area across from Maketewah Country Club. The street itself is beautiful| but there definitely seem to be some rough areas surrounding it.

KroGO Smart Carts,"Has anyone else tried the new smart carts at Kroger? Honestly pretty nifty for smaller/medium grocery trips. Once you get the hang of it| it’s pretty efficient. And they have some sort of spin the wheel promo where you get some $ off if you spend over $35

The computer it uses seems to process things pretty fast. It is nice to see a running total of what you’ve bought. Oh and also it automatically clipped coupons for me!!

In summary I would use it again for a smaller sized trip with no alcohol! Plus paper bags provided or you can use your reusable bags!

Louis Langree's extraordinary Grand Finale as the CSO's Music Director,"This weekend marked the Cincinnati Symphony's last concerts of the 23-24 Season| and of course with it the last concerts of Louis Langree's 11 year tenure as the Orchestra's Music Director.

There were performances on Friday and Saturday evening| and the very last one was this Sunday afternoon at 2 pm. There was zero chance that I would be missing this.

Before the start of the concert| the CSO President came out and said some kind words about Maetro Langree| reminding us of the many milestones reached during that time. Louis Langree addressed the crown briefly| and that he would have more today during the second half of the concert.

That second half turned out to be memorable on many levels. After an inspired ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (by the French composer Paul Dukas)| Langree did address the audience| at length. He mentioned that his wife and 2 (now college-aged) kids were in the audience| and reminisced how warmly the city had welcomes them all those years ago. Langree also commented very warmly about other aspects of life in Cincinnati| including the vibrant cultural scene. His biggest complements were for the Orchestra itself| and how he loved acquiring the ""Cincinnati DNA of this Orchestra"". He pointed out many things about the CSO| including the fact  that during his 11 year tenure| 37 musicians (more than 1/3 of the orchestra) were hired| and also that one of the orchestra's musicians was retiring after today's concert| having played 34 (!) years with the CSO.

Langree then dove into the very last piece of the day| an outstanding ""Daphnis et Chloe Suite No. 2"" by French composer Maurice Ravel. Upon the conclusion of that deeply emotional work| the audience burst into applause| and simply would not stop applauding. I saw some people leaving but the vast majority stayed and clapped. After several minutes of this| Louis Langree addressed the audience again| expressing his gratitude| etc. Then he told the true story that after his appointment as the CSO Music Director| the first concert he saw was actually a Cincinnati Pops show| with John Morris Russell conducting the Pops (which are of course the same musicians as the Symphony) playing action movie music like Mission Impossible| and James Bond. ""I was blown away"" gushed Langree| and then reminded us of having ""impossible dreams"" when he came to Cincinnati| which he eventually ended with ""I can now say: ""Mission Accomplished!""| and with that he led the CSO in playing the ""Mission Impossible"" theme.

It was by all accounts an extraordinary afternoon of music. I was also there for the last show of the departing prior Music Directors Jesus Lopez Cobos (in 2001) and Paavi Jarvi (in 2011)| and  it was nothing like what we witessed this afternoon at Music Hall.

Last but not least| Louis Langree reminded us that he will be back from time to time for the occasional concert| but most of all| he urged all of us to welcome the CSO's new Music Director Cristian Mӑcelaru with same warmth and open arms as he was welcomed here back in 2013.

Thank you for everything| Louis Langree! Godspeed to you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1cqky22/louis_langrees_extraordinary_grand_finale_as_the/,0

Like anyone else here my age| I listened to The Raisins on 96 Rock. Given the number of tapes of them and Psychodots and the Bears| they put out a lot of music over their lifespan.

I've never heard of One Brown Shoe or Scott Henderson.
The Ginger Sings tape is kind of funny. But it doesn't say who Ginger is.

r/Seattle Golden Gardens Meetup - 6/8/24 @ 3pm,"It's been a while since we did one of these...

***Our next official meetup is happening June 8th at 3:00 p.m. - at Golden Gardens park!***

RSVP on [discord ](https://discord.com/channels/370945003566006272/859665446319030282/1225327411076268052)and/or use our google form: [https://forms.gle/g5nAHUGinRH7a9hK9](https://forms.gle/g5nAHUGinRH7a9hK9)

If you've been to one of our bigger meetups in the past (previously labeled Global Reddit Meetup Day| when Reddit was still a fun company) - welcome back! Not much has changed about how these work| but I'll repeat the info below for the new folks.

For those of you new to our meetups| it's a way we engage with the community by hosting an outdoor picnic / potluck / hangout every year (sometimes multiple times a year - check our [discord](https://discord.gg/reddit-seattle) for more events). Here are the important details:

* **Who**: Everyone is welcome! This event is free| and anyone can join. It's run jointly by our subreddit mods and our [discord](https://discord.gg/reddit-seattle)| and is a great way to meet people and maybe make some new friends
* **What**: think of it as an outdoor hangout. Company picnic vibes but way more relaxed and more dogs (usually). Bring your friends| roommates| four-legged friends| food/drinks| blankets| outdoor activities| etc.
* **When**: June 8th at 3 p.m. until park close. Rain or shine| we'll be there! If weather sucks| depending on turnout we may move to a nearby bar or indoor venue| or we'll just play in the rain. It is Seattle| after all.
* **Where**: We'll be meeting at [Golden Gardens (shelter 1)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Sw2JgXVE3WozPZTt6) . Post in the day-of event thread or on our discord if you need help finding folks. We should have a big \`r/seattle\` banner| but either way we'll make sure people can find us.

Those are most of the important things| so if you read no further please just get these details and we hope to see you there! For communication about the event:

* We will make a new thread on the day of the event and link it here.
* If you're on discord and want notifications| we have [an event setup on our server](https://discord.gg/reddit-seattle?event=1221203323550568568) to ping members who RSVP. If you haven't been to our server yet| please stop by and say hello!
* Please use this thread and our discord to coordinate with other users if you're planning on bringing things| so we don't end up with everyone bringing the same Costco food item.

Some other (still important) notes:

* At Golden Gardens parking is TIGHT. ***Please*** use transit| rideshare| or carpool if you can| parking spots here fill up quick and the lots are always chaos. There is more parking up the hill towards Ballard and down the street on Seaview. You're welcome to coordinate rides with other users but please do so at your own risk.
* You are responsible for who and what you bring. Technically it is illegal to consume alcoholic beverages and other substances at Seattle parks. Just remember| you are ultimately responsible for yourself| we only ask that you make good decisions.
* Similar to the above| Seattle parks do not permit amplified audio devices. Small bluetooth speakers are likely ok if you want to play some music| but do so at your own risk. Again| please make good decisions.
* Things we'll provide:
   * Nametags
   * A few grills to cook (these are public outdoor grills| so keep that in mind)
   * Light snacks| water| sodas| etc.
* Things people usually bring:
   * A blanket| tarp| or chair (and something to weigh it down if it's windy)
   * A small cooler or bag of food and drinks for yourself and any to share with others if you wish
   * Your LEASHED dog if they're friendly and enjoy other people (and other dogs). There's going to be a lot of random internet friends and likely doggos around| so if your four-legged friend is reactive or shy it might be best to leave them at home.
   * Outdoor activities fit for the beach - frisbee| soccer/football| kites| etc.

Please let me know in this thread (or on discord) if you have any questions or if there's anything I left out. Hope to see you there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1cvdekf/rseattle_golden_gardens_meetup_6824_3pm/,0

Tomorrow night we play game #4 at home| with game #5 on Thursday| and I encourage all of you to come to the game to cheer the boys on!   The Winterhawks are a long-time Portland institution| having moved here in 1976| filling the gap left by the Bucaroos| who trace their linage back to 1928.

Tickets are decently cheap| $33 for upper bowl plus fees (unless you go and buy tickets on site| then you can avoid those fees)| and the game is super fun to watch.  This team has a shot at not just the divisional championship| but the league championship and potentially the Memorial Cup for the entire Canadian Hockey League!  Come cheer them on!  LETS GO HAWKS!

Best singles bars in Boston?,"I know this is a question that's been asked here before| and I've done some basic research from both those posts and elsewhere on the internet| but I wanted to see if I could find a list that's more up-to-date and specifically suits what I'm looking for.

How do the TD Garden policies apply recording at concerts?,"Hi there|

I'm going to a concert in TD Garden soon. I've looked around for recording policies| but due to TD Garden being primarily a sports center| do the 'No cameras/recording devices' still apply to concerts?

Their policy website read| ""No professional cameras| etc etc etc| no audio or recording devices of any kind."" Would that still apply to phones? I wanted to send videos to my friends when it happens. I've heard the security isn't strong/demanding from just around| not sure if it's true.

I tried to Google if it was allowed at concerts especially| but I never got a specific answer.

I'm sorry if this is a stupid question and I should just listen to what the website says| but I'm just not sure. I don't want to get kicked out if it's not prohibited but I also don't want to miss out in case I'm wrong.

Thanks for reading| hope you have an ananswer! Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cv8jb7/how_do_the_td_garden_policies_apply_recording_at/,0

Is it just me or has the traffic in Boston gotten so much worse over the past 5 years?,Especially on Wednesdays and Thursdays.

20 y/o Female Looking for Underground Boston Rap Scene,I love hip-hop music a lot| and I have been starting to get into it myself| but being a girl| I don't have many friends into the genre| I want to immerse myself into Boston's hiphop scene of rappers| producers| writers etc. Make friends and expand my horizons| does anyone know a good place for this?

Places to exist?,"Hey all|
I moved to Boston last summer. I’m a student| but I stay here year round in my apartment. It can get pretty lonely in the summers| and I’m trying to make sure I don’t spiral.

I’m looking for recommendations of places to go/be around other people| that don’t cost a ton of money. Ex. Going to a coffee shop| sitting in the public garden| etc. Also would love to hear recommendations for community building/groups/ways to meet people. I live near the theater district| and am sober.

Thank you all in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cpr5w5/places_to_exist/,0

Do people in Denver just keep to themselves?,Hey all| I’m in Denver for the long weekend| and I was just curious about the culture here. When I travel I tend to make friends everywhere I go. However| ever since I’ve been in Denver it seems like no one is interested in talking to someone they don’t know. I haven’t bar hopped or anything since I dont drink| but just exploring the downtown area no one seems interested in conversation. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1d1gxrs/do_people_in_denver_just_keep_to_themselves/,0
Anyone new to town? Just moved from Ohio and am looking to meet people,Hey y’all| I just moved out here from Cleveland for a change of scenery and something new. So far Denver has been awesome| but I would love a group of friends to explore it with or to show me around. Didn’t realize how hard it would be coming to a new place all alone. If anyone has any time or interest in showing me the ropes I’d appreciate it. I’m a 26m who likes snowboarding| camping| hiking| running| reading—pretty much anything active/challenging. If anyone wants to hang let me know! I don’t work a conventional 9-5 so I’m pretty flexible ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1d07s9z/anyone_new_to_town_just_moved_from_ohio_and_am/,1

Sports facilities tours in Denver,"Hi all! I’ll be visiting Denver over the next weekend and I’m a big fan of sports in general.

I never did a guided tour at basketball| baseball or football facilities and saw that Ball Arena| Coors Fields and Empower Fields all have guided tours. I’m wondering if any of you had taken those and if you think it was worth it.

Ball Arena cost $15| Coors $27 and Empower Field $40. Couldn’t really find any reviews online so appreciate any feedback. Main interest initially was on Empower Field but the price seems high.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1cw6c1d/sports_facilities_tours_in_denver/,0
Are Denver Private Country Clubs Worth It?,"I am a female in her late 30's planning on moving to Denver.  I am looking at possibly joining private clubs in the area.  This is to make connections| develop relationships and enjoy amenities (gym| restaurants| social gatherings| pools| maybe learn to play golf| etc.). I am ok spending a few hundred a month on this with initial fees being below double digit thousands.  Any recommendations| feedback| etc. from locals in the area?

I cannot afford extravagant fees. Looking for the ability to make friends| develop relationships (personal and professional).

Is going to the private club worth it?  Thanks to anyone who is willing to offer feedback :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1cs7wpj/are_denver_private_country_clubs_worth_it/,0
Sports bar for WNBA games,Are there any sports bar in the Denver area that broadcasts WNBA games? I’m newer to the area and thought I remembered seeing posts about a women’s sports bar… curious if this exists or is a rare breed since Denver doesn’t have a WNBA team.

The Denver dating scene sucks| let's try something crazy..,"As a 30-something woman| it's no secret that the apps are a fruitless time suck. There are so many Reddit posts asking how to meet people organically| everyone seems to go to the parks anyway| so I'm just throwing out a time| place| and way to identify each other. Bring your dog| wear a cool hat| have a fun fact about yourself ready to go! Fuck it| let's try something different.

Sunday| 5/19 @ noon| meet at Wash Park. Wear something green around your wrist. Let's find each other| get out of our comfort zones| and start a conversation!

Edit: To clarify| this isn't just for me to meet a bunch of suitors. The idea is for anyone that's single and looking to come out and easily identify who's up for a connection and talk to them! Sometimes it's nice meeting people outside of a bar environment. Also| I think it'd be awkward to specify a meeting place. Walk around| look for people that seem interesting| approach them!

For the haters... See you there ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1cnqxc1/the_denver_dating_scene_sucks_lets_try_something/,0

Event tomorrow: A March for Justice for Mica,"As the organizer of the upcoming march/protest for justice for Mica| I felt it was necessary to inform the local police department of our plans. I have reached out to Henry Bresadola| the operator of MB police department special events and permits| and am currently waiting for a response. Although we do not need a permit for our event| I believe it is only courteous to keep the authorities informed. I want to reassure you all that we will not be causing any disruptions or disturbances| as we will not be circling around the church or walking on that side of the street. Our goal is to raise awareness and bring attention to Mica's case| and we can do that without causing any unnecessary conflicts. I am excited to see what may come out of this protest| as we are standing for something that is important and deserving of attention. Abuse is never acceptable| and Mica deserves justice. I am praying for change| protection| peace| love| understanding| and the exposure of the truth. Thank you all for your support and suggestions. Please spread the word and invite others to join us as we stand for justice for Mica.

Sunday| May 5th at 9:00 am. We will be meeting at Horry Georgetown Technical College Grand Strand Campus at 8:30 am for a brief meeting to go over rules and distribute signs and purple flowers. I am also thrilled to announce that the owner and founder of MB Showcase Signs Reprographics will be providing car decals for free| which are similar to the t-shirts currently available for purchase from Palmetto Tides Design Co. Screen printing and more. Our planned route will be a lap on Howard Ave| followed by a left turn on Pampas Dr| another left on Hemlock Ave| leading us to Cactus St| and finally a left turn on Mallard Lake Dr| ending back at Pampas Dr in front of HGTC. Please come prepared wearing purple| carrying signs| and wearing comfortable walking shoes. And most importantly| bring your loud voice to make a powerful statement.

The rules are very simple.

1. Do not block traffic.

2. Do not litter.

3. No alcohol or drugs.

4. Stay on the route that I have chosen to go (it's a short route because I didn't want anyone to be overwhelmed with a lot of walking| but we can loop around as many times as we want to).

5. Be on time and leave on time. The start time is 9:00 am and the end time is 11:00 am. I gave us another hour just in case we need more time for interviews and if the news comes.

6. The signs can't be bigger than 24x36 inches.

7. Be respectful and no hate talk. (We can chant and be loud. that is what we want. We want to be heard but also we will be near other people's houses| just me but I wouldn't curse or say anything in that nature)

We are all grown people| we can do this without fighting| arguing and we can respect others. If for some reason a member from the church wants to threaten you| please yell for me. I have the police department on speed dial. But I'm very sure that everything will work out.

Just a side note. The Solid Rock Church hired 2 police officers to be standing guard while we walk| I told the event officer that we will stay on route going west from the church so we won't be on their grounds. But the church will hear us and see us. After explaining every detail of the event| the police department and the officer I spoke to sounded really excited about this protest and believes that everything should work out well.
Not a lot of rules to follow. The biggest rule is to stay on the route. I have documents in case the police come and ask for it. They can't tell us to go home until it ends.

Remember| we will meet up at 8:30 am at building 1000 at HGTC| we will have 30 minutes to fellowship| have coffee. Then we will walk at 9:00 am. This is for Mica| you| and other DV survivors. We will walk with love| courage and strength.

1. Knowingly damage property (2x)
2. Aggravated assault/deadly weapon
3. Possession of a liquor by minor (2x)
4. Possession of consumed liquor by a minor
5. Possession cannibis <2.5 grams (same night as the minors)
6. Contributing to the delinquency of a child
7. Domestic battery/bodily harm
8. Domestic battery/physical contact
9. Assault/assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (2x)
10. Being on premises after warning or refuse to leave

The two got married when Mica was 23| and JP was 37. JP is the owner of the church Solid Rock| and from local reviews| ran off a lot of people. He had misogynistic views| would verbally attack people| and everyone feared for Mica. He verbally| financially| mentally| physically| spiritually| and sexually assaulted her throughout their marriage. If she wanted to leave| he would have her committed to the mental hospital. He openly talked about her struggles during his sermons| as did she. JP failed to mention HE was the reason for her mental struggles. He would emotionally torture her| make her watch him have sex with other women in front of her| slash her tires| stalk her| put tracking devices on her car| she was even sleeping couch to couch terrified of him finding and committing her again. From another friend| Mica escaped JP in February 2024. Friends were hiding Mica. She found out he was doing things with the money from the church and after that he put her in a mental hospital| again. When she got out| she told her friend| ""I am not mentally ill| I'm not sick| I don't want to harm myself| and he is going to make it look like I killed myself. He's going to try to frame me. One day I know he's going to do it."" The church is not listed with the Southern Baptist Convention| nor it is listed as a non-profit. This could have been what Mica found out| he was committing tax fraud and had been for years. This last month| she started reconnecting with friends that JP had forced her to isolate from. One message from Mica to a friend on April 5 reads| :Thank.you for your gentle warnings throughout the years regarding my relationship with JP. I know that you knew I wasn't ready to get out but looking back your warnings were very helpful when trying to make tough life decisions. Definitely have replayed our convo's in my head over and over throughout the years and wished there was something I could do to get out. And now I've done it :)""

To give you an example of what this guy is like when he preaches| In February 2024| here's part of a sermon he read aloud to his churchgoers: You know| a year ago| my wife| they went to Africa they had a wonderful trip and she came back with the idea to start a school in Africa. And 6 weeks ago she ""**goes to the hospital""**| gets out| and just leaves me| completely leaves me| drains our bank accounts| and I go| ""Guess what? While you're talking bad about me out there I'm building a school in Africa for over 100 kids in order for them to be fed!"" ...Goes on about God. then ""One day I'm gonna preach to God about getting rich| strong| healthy| and finding a hot wife that loves Jesus! That's what I'm gonna do."" Then| he continues to bash Mica saying ""When my wife was in the hospital| um you know I looked at her phone| and I counted over the past 2 years| 18 people who had text her and said ""If you ever want to talk to someone about your husband| you can talk to me and say anything and I'll keep it confidential."" This made him VISIBLY angry while on stage.

Mica filed for divorce and a protective order 48 hours before she was found dead.

The crime: In her final week she made plans to get her hair cut| get help with her car payment because she was a little short after paying the divorce lawyer| and planned on meeting her friends at a church service Sunday| April 28. On Saturday| April 27| Mica left in her work uniform to work at JPeters| a local restaurant. She never showed. Her body was discovered an hour and a half away| in Lumberton| NC. Her cause of death is a gun shot wound to the head. JP was not allowing her family to see her and was pushing for a quick cremation (that was denied and the family has seen her).
Hours later| her husband| holds church service as normal Sunday| April 29. He has no remorse| emotion| and cracks jokes during his sermon. In the last 30 seconds of it| he says (and I'm paraphrasing but listening to it as I go) ""I have an announcement and I ask that after it you leave the church and do not talk about my announcement. I hope you continue to come to church and serve and give| you know| for the next little bit| I'm taking a little bit of a break| and I don't want to have to worry about the church. My break might be a few days| or a few weeks| I don't know. Uh I got a call late last night my wife has passed away and yeah it was self induced and it was up in North Carolina. And um we'll have a funeral for her next Sunday here at 3:00| and um yeah that's- I'm just| you know| going on adrenaline right now. Yall know she wasn't well mentally and uh she needed her medicine that was hard to get."" (There is a video of this| despite JP deleting it from their church YouTube).
3 days later her husband is seen and photographed at Coastal Grand Mall going into a sushi restaurant with his supposed girlfriend| Suzi. He is looking right into the camera.
4 days later he is seen and photographed in a restaurant called Kingstreet Grille with the same supposed girlfriend| Suzi. She is looking at the camera with her eyebrows raised and her hand over her mouth.

On May 1| JP informed a news outlet he could not do their scheduled interview as he was leaving town for a few days. Today| May 3| the church has permanently closed.

SUZI SKINNER'S HUSBAND'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH (Girl from recent photos): it was common knowledge that JP and Suzi had been dating for a years. They have been sharing food and blankets at soccer games and they've been seen at the water park. in 2021| Suzi's then husband| who was paralyzed and lived his life in a wheelchair| drowned in a pool and it was ""accidental” (edited).

WAYNE MILLER (AND ANOTHER MYSTERIOUS DEATH): (Living in Myrtle Beach as well) Arrested for hooking up with a minor in a shower| molestation charges| and then had the charges expunged. This was in the 90's.
He forced J1 visa students who paid to trail to the US to attend his ""bible college""| failure to pay them even minimum wage| failure to provide them with adequate shelter| food and more. He had federal charges from ICE for abusing the immigrant students while with him.
He was exposed for lewd acts in Pakistan a few years back. He was living in a private society at the time called Eden Garden| which was full of younger boys. Remember| he has a history of molestation. Jerry Savelle| who started a church in Pakistan that Wayne was associated with| passed away on April 14| 2024 with no clear cause of death. In a video| you can see them talk about how Dr. Jerry Seville didn't know all the illegal things Wayne was doing and didn't realize he (Savelle) was contributing to.
Also in Pakistan| he had a plan to make a false accusation in the Pakistan Court system because he was about to get exposed for his homosexual relationship and all the sexual abuse he was committing there. The allegations (we don't know what they were) were proven to be false by Pakistan Court this past October. He then had his male lover come to America with his Pakistan sister| and Troy (Wayne's friend) was the ""sponsor"" to marry the sister so they could come here. An article about Troy from 2003 reads| ""A former Myrtle Beach area pastor is facing charges of child molestation. 32-year old Robert Troy Taylor turned himself in to Georgetown County Authorities Saturday. He's the former pastor at the Low Country Community Church in Murrell's Inlet| just south of Myrtle Beach. The charges are reportedly connected to two incidents with 12- year old boys from more than a decade ago."" The company you keep.....

JP's OLDER SON: He has a history of domestic abuse against his wife and served time for hitting her over the head with a glass bottle in January 2024.

Search the hashtag JusticeForMica on Facebook and you can see videos| pictures| text messages| etc. Please ignore the obituary this abuser wrote| it is so disgusting. Paints himself in an amazing light. This is only the beginning. Her death was called a suicide| but Robeson County is investigating it and ALL of this information has been sent to our local police department as well as Robeson County. A protest is being held on the public property outside of the church and walk around a few blocks on Sunday at 9:00 am| even though the news came out today they are closed. This is for Mica. One of her last videos she uploaded to her Facebook was her speaking out about her abuse| and she looks so empty inside.

Sorry if this was confusing| but police have barely released any information except the basics. But the rest were from old articles and people's stories about her. I tried to piece it all together the best I could to show this entire family is about to go down| as they should have a long time ago.


Edited to add: JP Miller announced the cause of death before police did. As if any more suspicion from him was needed..",https://www.reddit.com/r/MyrtleBeach/comments/1cjqi58/myrtle_beach_pastor_announces_wifes_death_after/,0

Living in market common vs wilmington,"Absolutely love the market common area. As a big dog lover it's very walkable and the dog parks are a nice cherry on top.

I'm currently down in pawleys and so out of place as a 30 year old dude looking to meet people more my age| with not much to do. Everything is such a ride from here!

Then I got wilmington. More expensive but much more to do| with a much cleaner city compared to Myrtle (and less crime). But much more traffic| and they are getting even more over populated than the grand strand. Will likely be Charleston 2.0 soon.

The Healthcare is so bad in Myrtle Beach| my aunt had to move,"Yep this ass Backwards place. She has had trauma and mental health problems for about 10 years now. She has been on meds for her symptoms. She decided to try to help her mental health by starting fresh in dirty myrtle.

Boy was that a mistake. She couldn't even get an
 appointment for months| Let alone get a working number for a psychiatrist. The one place told her they couldn't see her because she was on too high of a dose.

The Healthcare is stuck in the 2000s at Myrtle Beach. SC is ranked 41st in Healthcare and it is reflected in dirty Myrtle.

My aunt thought she could move by the beach for peace of mind. She almost ended up in the hospital because of incompetent Healthcare.

Mental health is important and the doctors in Myrtle Beach should be ashamed of themselves.

Clearly it's not a secret:

Pensacola A Good Place to Move for 20s-30s Couple?,"Hello! My wife and I are looking to move from north central Florida (Lake City AKA Lake Shitty) to the panhandle area. We want to live less than 30 minutes from a beautiful beach. We currently live about an hour or so from Jax beach| but that's too far and Jax beach is disappointing. We prefer the gulf beaches. We want to be outdoors more and participate in water activities more. We are not heavy drinkers or frequent clubs or anything. We enjoy getting out of the house and meeting people and having things to do though (escape rooms| cool local spots| coffee shops| etc).

My wife eventually wants to work in education and we know there's a university there. I currently work partly remote.

The current area we live in is high in crime. Like ridiculously high in crime. So we want to move to a safer place.

We like small town city vibes. But with things to actually do.

Would Pensacola be a good area for us?Obviously this is subjective and we plan to visit later this year since we have a wedding to go to in Pensacola. So that we can see what the city is actually like.

TLDR; Young couple looking to move to a nice beach town that's affordable| safe| has things to do to meet people and make friends| but is also not too big of a city. We originally thought Port St. Joe| but there's just nothing there. Please give your thoughts and opinions!

LOVE Seafood| could live off of it.

HATE big city life| been in DFW for 22 years and atlanta before that. #OVERIT
